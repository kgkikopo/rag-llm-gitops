# 2.13. Configuring fair sharing

You can configure fair sharing as a preemption strategy to distribute borrowable resources equally or by weight between tenants of a cohort. 

Borrowable resources are the unused nominal quota of all the cluster queues in a cohort. 

You can configure fair sharing by setting the `preemptionPolicy` value in the `Kueue` custom resource (CR) to `FairSharing`. 

## 2.13.1. Cluster queue weights

After you enable fair sharing, you must configure a `weight` value for each cluster queue to define how borrowable resources are distributed among competing workloads. 

Share values are important because they allow administrators to prioritize specific job types or teams. Critical applications or high-priority teams can be configured with a weighted value so that they receive a proportionally larger share of the available resources. Configuring weights ensures that unused resources are distributed according to defined organizational or project priorities rather than on a first-come, first-served basis. 

The `weight` value, or share value, defines a comparative advantage for the cluster queue when competing for borrowable resources. Generally, Red Hat build of Kueue admits jobs with a lower share value first. Jobs with a higher share value are more likely to be preempted before those with lower share values. 

**Example cluster queue with a fair sharing weight configured**

```yaml
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: ClusterQueue
metadata:
  name: cluster-queue
spec:
  namespaceSelector: {}
  resourceGroups:
  - coveredResources: ["cpu"]
    flavors:
    - name: default-flavor
      resources:
      - name: cpu
        nominalQuota: 9
  cohortName: example-cohort
  fairSharing:
    weight: 2
```


### 2.13.1.1. Zero weight

A `weight` value of `0` represents an infinite share value. This means that the cluster queue is always at a disadvantage compared to others, and its workloads are always the first to be preempted when fair sharing is enabled.
