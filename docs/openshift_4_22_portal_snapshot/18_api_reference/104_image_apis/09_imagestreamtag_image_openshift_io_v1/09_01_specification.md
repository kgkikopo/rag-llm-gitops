# 9.1. Specification

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`apiVersion` |  `string` |  APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources>  
`conditions` |  `array` |  conditions is an array of conditions that apply to the image stream tag.   
`conditions[]` |  `object` |  TagEventCondition contains condition information for a tag event.   
`generation` |  `integer` |  generation is the current generation of the tagged image - if tag is provided and this value is not equal to the tag generation, a user has requested an import that has not completed, or conditions will be filled out indicating any error.   
`image` |  `object` |  Image is an immutable representation of a container image and its metadata at a point in time. Images are named by taking a hash of their contents (metadata and content) and any change in format, content, or metadata results in a new name. The images resource is primarily for use by cluster administrators and integrations like the cluster image registry - end users, instead, access images via the imagestreamtags or imagestreamimages resources. While image metadata is stored in the API, any integration that implements the container image registry API must provide its own storage for the raw manifest data, image config, and layer contents.  Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).   
`kind` |  `string` |  Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds>  
`lookupPolicy` |  `object` |  ImageLookupPolicy describes how an image stream can be used to override the image references used by pods, builds, and other resources in a namespace.   
`metadata` |  [`ObjectMeta`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/common_object_reference/#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta) |  metadata is the standard object’s metadata. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata>  
`tag` |  `object` |  TagReference specifies optional annotations for images using this tag and an optional reference to an ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, or DockerImage this tag should track.

## 9.1.15. .tag

Description
     TagReference specifies optional annotations for images using this tag and an optional reference to an ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, or DockerImage this tag should track.

Property| Type| Description

`annotations` |  `object (string)` |  Optional; if specified, annotations that are applied to images retrieved via ImageStreamTags.   
`from` |  [`ObjectReference`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/common_object_reference/#io-k8s-api-core-v1-ObjectReference) |  Optional; if specified, a reference to another image that this tag should point to. Valid values are ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, and DockerImage. ImageStreamTag references can only reference a tag within this same ImageStream.   
`generation` |  `integer` |  generation is a counter that tracks mutations to the spec tag (user intent). When a tag reference is changed the generation is set to match the current stream generation (which is incremented every time spec is changed). Other processes in the system like the image importer observe that the generation of spec tag is newer than the generation recorded in the status and use that as a trigger to import the newest remote tag. To trigger a new import, clients may set this value to zero which will reset the generation to the latest stream generation. Legacy clients will send this value as nil which will be merged with the current tag generation.   
`importPolicy` |  `object` |  TagImportPolicy controls how images related to this tag will be imported.   
`name` |  `string` |  name of the tag   
`reference` |  `boolean` |  reference states if the tag will be imported. Default value is false, which means the tag will be imported.   
`referencePolicy` |  `object` |  TagReferencePolicy describes how pull-specs for images in this image stream tag are generated when image change triggers in deployment configs or builds are resolved. This allows the image stream author to control how images are accessed.

## 9.1.16. .tag.importPolicy

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`importMode` |  `string` |  importMode describes how to import an image manifest.   
`insecure` |  `boolean` |  insecure is true if the server may bypass certificate verification or connect directly over HTTP during image import.   
`scheduled` |  `boolean` |  scheduled indicates to the server that this tag should be periodically checked to ensure it is up to date, and imported

## 9.1.17. .tag.referencePolicy

Description
     TagReferencePolicy describes how pull-specs for images in this image stream tag are generated when image change triggers in deployment configs or builds are resolved. This allows the image stream author to control how images are accessed. 
Type
     `object`
Required
    

  * `type`



Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`type` |  `string` |  type determines how the image pull spec should be transformed when the image stream tag is used in deployment config triggers or new builds. The default value is `Source`, indicating the original location of the image should be used (if imported). The user may also specify `Local`, indicating that the pull spec should point to the integrated container image registry and leverage the registry’s ability to proxy the pull to an upstream registry. `Local` allows the credentials used to pull this image to be managed from the image stream’s namespace, so others on the platform can access a remote image but have no access to the remote secret. It also allows the image layers to be mirrored into the local registry which the images can still be pulled even if the upstream registry is unavailable.
