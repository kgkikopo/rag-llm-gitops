# 7.1. Specification

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`apiVersion` |  `string` |  APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources>  
`image` |  `object` |  Image is an immutable representation of a container image and its metadata at a point in time. Images are named by taking a hash of their contents (metadata and content) and any change in format, content, or metadata results in a new name. The images resource is primarily for use by cluster administrators and integrations like the cluster image registry - end users, instead, access images via the imagestreamtags or imagestreamimages resources. While image metadata is stored in the API, any integration that implements the container image registry API must provide its own storage for the raw manifest data, image config, and layer contents.  Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).   
`kind` |  `string` |  Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds>  
`metadata` |  [`ObjectMeta`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/common_object_reference/#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta) |  metadata is the standard object’s metadata. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata>  
`tag` |  `string` |  tag is a string value this image can be located with inside the stream.

Description
    

Image is an immutable representation of a container image and its metadata at a point in time. Images are named by taking a hash of their contents (metadata and content) and any change in format, content, or metadata results in a new name. The images resource is primarily for use by cluster administrators and integrations like the cluster image registry - end users, instead, access images via the imagestreamtags or imagestreamimages resources. While image metadata is stored in the API, any integration that implements the container image registry API must provide its own storage for the raw manifest data, image config, and layer contents. 

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

`dockerImageConfig` |  `string` |  dockerImageConfig is a JSON blob that the runtime uses to set up the container. This is a part of manifest schema v2. Will not be set when the image represents a manifest list.   
`dockerImageLayers` |  `array` |  dockerImageLayers represents the layers in the image. May not be set if the image does not define that data or if the image represents a manifest list.   
`dockerImageLayers[]` |  `object` |  ImageLayer represents a single layer of the image. Some images may have multiple layers. Some may have none.   
`dockerImageManifest` |  `string` |  dockerImageManifest is the raw JSON of the manifest

`dockerImageManifests[]` |  `object` |  ImageManifest represents sub-manifests of a manifest list. The Digest field points to a regular Image object.

`dockerImageMetadataVersion` |  `string` |  dockerImageMetadataVersion conveys the version of the object, which if empty defaults to "1.0"   
`dockerImageReference` |  `string` |  dockerImageReference is the string that can be used to pull this image.   
`dockerImageSignatures` |  `array (string)` |  dockerImageSignatures provides the signatures as opaque blobs. This is a part of manifest schema v1.   
`kind` |  `string` |  Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds>

More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata>  
`signatures` |  `array` |  signatures holds all signatures of the image.   
`signatures[]` |  `object` |  ImageSignature holds a signature of an image. It allows to verify image identity and possibly other claims as long as the signature is trusted. Based on this information it is possible to restrict runnable images to those matching cluster-wide policy. Mandatory fields should be parsed by clients doing image verification. The others are parsed from signature’s content by the server. They serve just an informative purpose.  Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
