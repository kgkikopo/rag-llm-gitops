---|---|---  
`apiVersion` |  `string` |  APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources>  
`kind` |  `string` |  Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds>

## 6.1.1. .spec

Description
     ValidatingAdmissionPolicySpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the AdmissionPolicy. 
Type
     `object`

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`auditAnnotations` |  `array` |  auditAnnotations contains CEL expressions which are used to produce audit annotations for the audit event of the API request. validations and auditAnnotations may not both be empty; a least one of validations or auditAnnotations is required.   
`auditAnnotations[]` |  `object` |  AuditAnnotation describes how to produce an audit annotation for an API request.   
`failurePolicy` |  `string` |  failurePolicy defines how to handle failures for the admission policy. Failures can occur from CEL expression parse errors, type check errors, runtime errors and invalid or mis-configured policy definitions or bindings.  A policy is invalid if spec.paramKind refers to a non-existent Kind. A binding is invalid if spec.paramRef.name refers to a non-existent resource.  failurePolicy does not define how validations that evaluate to false are handled.  When failurePolicy is set to Fail, ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding validationActions define how failures are enforced.  Allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Fail.  Possible enum values: - `"Fail"` means that an error calling the webhook causes the admission to fail. - `"Ignore"` means that an error calling the webhook is ignored.   
`matchConditions` |  `array` |  MatchConditions is a list of conditions that must be met for a request to be validated. Match conditions filter requests that have already been matched by the rules, namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of matchConditions matches all requests. There are a maximum of 64 match conditions allowed.  If a parameter object is provided, it can be accessed via the `params` handle in the same manner as validation expressions.  The exact matching logic is (in order): 1. If ANY matchCondition evaluates to FALSE, the policy is skipped. 2. If ALL matchConditions evaluate to TRUE, the policy is evaluated. 3. If any matchCondition evaluates to an error (but none are FALSE): - If failurePolicy=Fail, reject the request - If failurePolicy=Ignore, the policy is skipped   
`matchConditions[]` |  `object` |  MatchCondition represents a condition which must by fulfilled for a request to be sent to a webhook.   
`matchConstraints` |  `object` |  MatchResources decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether it meets the match criteria. The exclude rules take precedence over include rules (if a resource matches both, it is excluded)   
`paramKind` |  `object` |  ParamKind is a tuple of Group Kind and Version.   
`validations` |  `array` |  Validations contain CEL expressions which is used to apply the validation. Validations and AuditAnnotations may not both be empty; a minimum of one Validations or AuditAnnotations is required.   
`validations[]` |  `object` |  Validation specifies the CEL expression which is used to apply the validation.   
`variables` |  `array` |  Variables contain definitions of variables that can be used in composition of other expressions. Each variable is defined as a named CEL expression. The variables defined here will be available under `variables` in other expressions of the policy except MatchConditions because MatchConditions are evaluated before the rest of the policy.  The expression of a variable can refer to other variables defined earlier in the list but not those after. Thus, Variables must be sorted by the order of first appearance and acyclic.   
`variables[]` |  `object` |  Variable is the definition of a variable that is used for composition. A variable is defined as a named expression.

## 6.1.2. .spec.auditAnnotations

Description
     auditAnnotations contains CEL expressions which are used to produce audit annotations for the audit event of the API request. validations and auditAnnotations may not both be empty; a least one of validations or auditAnnotations is required. 
Type

## 6.1.3. .spec.auditAnnotations[]

Description
     AuditAnnotation describes how to produce an audit annotation for an API request. 
Type
     `object`
Required
    

  * `key`
  * `valueExpression`



Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`key` |  `string` |  key specifies the audit annotation key. The audit annotation keys of a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy must be unique. The key must be a qualified name ([A-Za-z0-9][-A-Za-z0-9_.]*) no more than 63 bytes in length.  The key is combined with the resource name of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy to construct an audit annotation key: "{ValidatingAdmissionPolicy name}/{key}".  If an admission webhook uses the same resource name as this ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and the same audit annotation key, the annotation key will be identical. In this case, the first annotation written with the key will be included in the audit event and all subsequent annotations with the same key will be discarded.  Required.   
`valueExpression` |  `string` |  valueExpression represents the expression which is evaluated by CEL to produce an audit annotation value. The expression must evaluate to either a string or null value. If the expression evaluates to a string, the audit annotation is included with the string value. If the expression evaluates to null or empty string the audit annotation will be omitted. The valueExpression may be no longer than 5kb in length. If the result of the valueExpression is more than 10kb in length, it will be truncated to 10kb.  If multiple ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding resources match an API request, then the valueExpression will be evaluated for each binding. All unique values produced by the valueExpressions will be joined together in a comma-separated list.  Required.

CEL expressions have access to the contents of the AdmissionRequest and Authorizer, organized into CEL variables:  'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. 'request' - Attributes of the admission request(/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest). 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request. See <https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz> 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the request resource. Documentation on CEL: <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/> Required.

## 6.1.6. .spec.matchConstraints

Description
     MatchResources decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether it meets the match criteria. The exclude rules take precedence over include rules (if a resource matches both, it is excluded) 
Type
     `object`

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`excludeResourceRules` |  `array` |  ExcludeResourceRules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy should not care about. The exclude rules take precedence over include rules (if a resource matches both, it is excluded)   
`excludeResourceRules[]` |  `object` |  NamedRuleWithOperations is a tuple of Operations and Resources with ResourceNames.   
`matchPolicy` |  `string` |  matchPolicy defines how the "MatchResources" list is used to match incoming requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".  \- Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.  \- Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.  Defaults to "Equivalent"  Possible enum values: - `"Equivalent"` means requests should be sent to the webhook if they modify a resource listed in rules via another API group or version. - `"Exact"` means requests should only be sent to the webhook if they exactly match a given rule.   
`namespaceSelector` |  [`LabelSelector`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/common_object_reference/#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-LabelSelector) |  NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the policy.  For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "runlevel", "operator": "NotIn", "values": [ "0", "1" ] } ] }  If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "environment", "operator": "In", "values": [ "prod", "staging" ] } ] }  See <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/> for more examples of label selectors.  Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.   
`objectSelector` |  [`LabelSelector`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/common_object_reference/#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-LabelSelector) |  ObjectSelector decides whether to run the validation based on if the object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the cel validation, and is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.   
`resourceRules` |  `array` |  ResourceRules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy matches. The policy cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule.   
`resourceRules[]` |  `object` |  NamedRuleWithOperations is a tuple of Operations and Resources with ResourceNames.

  * `expression`



Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`expression` |  `string` |  Expression represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: <https://github.com/google/cel-spec> CEL expressions have access to the contents of the API request/response, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:  \- 'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests. - 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests. - 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)). - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind. - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources. - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value. For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'. - 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request. See <https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz> \- 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the request resource.  The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object. No other metadata properties are accessible.  Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '_' escapes to '_ underscores _' - '.' escapes to '_ dot _' - '-' escapes to '_ dash _' - '/' escapes to '_ slash _' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '_{keyword}_'. The keywords are: "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if", "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return". Examples: - Expression accessing a property named "namespace": {"Expression": "object._ namespace _ > 0"} - Expression accessing a property named "x-prop": {"Expression": "object.x_dash _prop > 0"} - Expression accessing a property named "redact_d": {"Expression": "object.redact _underscores_ d > 0"}  Equality on arrays with list type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type: - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order. - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order. Required.   
`message` |  `string` |  Message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Expression contains line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks. If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}". e.g. "must be a URL with the host matching spec.host" If the Expression contains line breaks. Message is required. The message must not contain line breaks. If unset, the message is "failed Expression: {Expression}".   
`messageExpression` |  `string` |  messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails. Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string. If both message and messageExpression are present on a validation, then messageExpression will be used if validation fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the runtime error is logged, and the validation failure message is produced as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset, and the fact that messageExpression produced an empty string/string with only spaces/string with line breaks will be logged. messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the `expression` except for 'authorizer' and 'authorizer.requestResource'. Example: "object.x must be less than max ("string(params.max)")"   
`reason` |  `string` |  Reason represents a machine-readable description of why this validation failed. If this is the first validation in the list to fail, this reason, as well as the corresponding HTTP response code, are used in the HTTP response to the client. The currently supported reasons are: "Unauthorized", "Forbidden", "Invalid", "RequestEntityTooLarge". If not set, StatusReasonInvalid is used in the response to the client.
