Dual-stack clusters may set 2 IPs (one for each IP family), otherwise only 1 IP is allowed. This field is only allowed for "Primary" network. It is not recommended to set this field without explicit need and understanding of the OVN network topology. When omitted, an IP from the subnets field is used.   
`infrastructureSubnets` |  `array (string)` |  infrastructureSubnets specifies a list of internal CIDR ranges that OVN-Kubernetes will reserve for internal network infrastructure. Any IP addresses within these ranges cannot be assigned to workloads. When omitted, OVN-Kubernetes will automatically allocate IP addresses from `subnets` for its infrastructure needs. When there are not enough available IPs in the provided infrastructureSubnets, OVN-Kubernetes will automatically allocate IP addresses from subnets for its infrastructure needs. When `reservedSubnets` is also specified the CIDRs cannot overlap. When `defaultGatewayIPs` is also specified, the default gateway IPs must belong to one of the infrastructure subnet CIDRs. Each item should be in range of the specified CIDR(s) in `subnets`. The maximum number of entries allowed is 4. The format should match standard CIDR notation (for example, "10.128.0.0/16"). This field must be omitted if `subnets` is unset or `ipam.mode` is `Disabled`.

     `object`

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`lifecycle` |  `string` |  Lifecycle controls IP addresses management lifecycle.  The only allowed value is Persistent. When set, the IP addresses assigned by OVN Kubernetes will be persisted in an `ipamclaims.k8s.cni.cncf.io` object. These IP addresses will be reused by other pods if requested. Only supported when mode is `Enabled`.   
`mode` |  `string` |  Mode controls how much of the IP configuration will be managed by OVN. `Enabled` means OVN-Kubernetes will apply IP configuration to the SDN infrastructure and it will also assign IPs from the selected subnet to the individual pods. `Disabled` means OVN-Kubernetes will only assign MAC addresses and provide layer 2 communication, letting users configure IP addresses for the pods. `Disabled` is only available for Secondary networks. By disabling IPAM, any Kubernetes features that rely on selecting pods by IP will no longer function (such as network policy, services, etc). Additionally, IP port security will also be disabled for interfaces attached to this network. Defaults to `Enabled`.

  * `role`



Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`excludeSubnets` |  `array (string)` |  excludeSubnets is a list of CIDRs to be removed from the specified CIDRs in `subnets`. The CIDRs in this list must be in range of at least one subnet specified in `subnets`. excludeSubnets is optional. When omitted no IP address is excluded and all IP addresses specified in `subnets` are subject to assignment. The format should match standard CIDR notation (for example, "10.128.0.0/16"). This field must be omitted if `subnets` is unset or `ipam.mode` is `Disabled`. When `physicalNetworkName` points to OVS bridge mapping of a network with reserved IP addresses (which shouldn’t be assigned by OVN-Kubernetes), the specified CIDRs will not be assigned. For example: Given: `subnets: "10.0.0.0/24"`, `excludeSubnets: "10.0.0.200/30", the following addresses will not be assigned to pods: `10.0.0.201`, `10.0.0.202`.   
`ipam` |  `object` |  ipam configurations for the network. ipam is optional. When omitted, `subnets` must be specified. When `ipam.mode` is `Disabled`, `subnets` must be omitted. `ipam.mode` controls how much of the IP configuration will be managed by OVN. When `Enabled`, OVN-Kubernetes will apply IP configuration to the SDN infra and assign IPs from the selected subnet to the pods. When `Disabled`, OVN-Kubernetes only assigns MAC addresses, and provides layer2 communication, and enables users to configure IP addresses on the pods. `ipam.lifecycle` controls IP addresses management lifecycle. When set to 'Persistent', the assigned IP addresses will be persisted in `ipamclaims.k8s.cni.cncf.io` object. Useful for VMs, IP address will be persistent after restarts and migrations. Supported when `ipam.mode` is `Enabled`.   
`mtu` |  `integer` |  mtu is the maximum transmission unit for a network. mtu is optional. When omitted, the configured value in OVN-Kubernetes (defaults to 1500 for localnet topology) is used for the network. Minimum value for IPv4 subnet is 576, and for IPv6 subnet is 1280. Maximum value is 65536. In a scenario `physicalNetworkName` points to OVS bridge mapping of a network configured with certain MTU settings, this field enables configuring the same MTU on pod interface, having the pod MTU aligned with the network MTU. Misaligned MTU across the stack (e.g.: pod has MTU X, node NIC has MTU Y), could result in network disruptions and bad performance.   
`physicalNetworkName` |  `string` |  physicalNetworkName points to the OVS bridge-mapping’s network-name configured in the nodes, required. Min length is 1, max length is 253, cannot contain `,` or `:` characters. In case OVS bridge-mapping is defined by Kubernetes-nmstate with `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP), this field should point to the NNCP `spec.desiredState.ovn.bridge-mappings` item’s `localnet` value.   
`role` |  `string` |  role describes the network role in the pod, required. Controls whether the pod interface will act as primary or secondary. Localnet topology supports `Secondary` only. The network will be assigned to pods that have the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` annotation in place pointing to subject.   
`subnets` |  `array (string)` |  subnets is a list of subnets used for pods in this localnet network across the cluster. The list may be either 1 IPv4 subnet, 1 IPv6 subnet, or 1 of each IP family. When set, OVN-Kubernetes assigns an IP address from the specified CIDRs to the connected pod, eliminating the need for manual IP assignment or reliance on an external IPAM service (e.g., a DHCP server). subnets is optional. When omitted OVN-Kubernetes won’t assign IP address automatically. Dual-stack clusters may set 2 subnets (one for each IP family), otherwise only 1 subnet is allowed. The format should match standard CIDR notation (for example, "10.128.0.0/16"). This field must be omitted if `ipam.mode` is `Disabled`. When physicalNetworkName points to the OVS bridge mapping of a network that provides IPAM services (e.g., a DHCP server), ipam.mode should be set to Disabled. This turns off OVN-Kubernetes IPAM and avoids conflicts with the existing IPAM services on this localnet network.   
`vlan` |  `object` |  vlan configuration for the network. vlan.mode is the VLAN mode. When "Access" is set, OVN-Kubernetes configures the network logical switch port in access mode. vlan.access is the access VLAN configuration. vlan.access.id is the VLAN ID (VID) to be set on the network logical switch port. vlan is optional, when omitted the underlying network default VLAN will be used (usually `1`). When set, OVN-Kubernetes will apply VLAN configuration to the SDN infra and to the connected pods.

## 2.1.15. .spec.network.localnet.ipam

Description
     ipam configurations for the network. ipam is optional. When omitted, `subnets` must be specified. When `ipam.mode` is `Disabled`, `subnets` must be omitted. `ipam.mode` controls how much of the IP configuration will be managed by OVN. When `Enabled`, OVN-Kubernetes will apply IP configuration to the SDN infra and assign IPs from the selected subnet to the pods. When `Disabled`, OVN-Kubernetes only assigns MAC addresses, and provides layer2 communication, and enables users to configure IP addresses on the pods. `ipam.lifecycle` controls IP addresses management lifecycle. When set to 'Persistent', the assigned IP addresses will be persisted in `ipamclaims.k8s.cni.cncf.io` object. Useful for VMs, IP address will be persistent after restarts and migrations. Supported when `ipam.mode` is `Enabled`.
