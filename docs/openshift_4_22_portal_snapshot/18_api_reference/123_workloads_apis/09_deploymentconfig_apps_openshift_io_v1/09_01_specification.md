# 9.1. Specification

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`apiVersion` |  `string` |  APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources>  
`kind` |  `string` |  Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds>  
`metadata` |  [`ObjectMeta`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/common_object_reference/#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta) |  metadata is the standard object’s metadata. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata>  
`spec` |  `object` |  DeploymentConfigSpec represents the desired state of the deployment.   
`status` |  `object` |  DeploymentConfigStatus represents the current deployment state.

## 9.1.1. .spec

Description
     DeploymentConfigSpec represents the desired state of the deployment. 
Type
     `object`

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`minReadySeconds` |  `integer` |  minReadySeconds is the minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)   
`paused` |  `boolean` |  paused indicates that the deployment config is paused resulting in no new deployments on template changes or changes in the template caused by other triggers.   
`replicas` |  `integer` |  replicas is the number of desired replicas.   
`revisionHistoryLimit` |  `integer` |  revisionHistoryLimit is the number of old ReplicationControllers to retain to allow for rollbacks. This field is a pointer to allow for differentiation between an explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 10. (This only applies to DeploymentConfigs created via the new group API resource, not the legacy resource.)   
`selector` |  `object (string)` |  selector is a label query over pods that should match the Replicas count.   
`strategy` |  `object` |  DeploymentStrategy describes how to perform a deployment.   
`template` |  [`PodTemplateSpec`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/common_object_reference/#io-k8s-api-core-v1-PodTemplateSpec) |  template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if insufficient replicas are detected.   
`test` |  `boolean` |  test ensures that this deployment config will have zero replicas except while a deployment is running. This allows the deployment config to be used as a continuous deployment test - triggering on images, running the deployment, and then succeeding or failing. Post strategy hooks and After actions can be used to integrate successful deployment with an action.   
`triggers` |  `array` |  triggers determine how updates to a DeploymentConfig result in new deployments. If no triggers are defined, a new deployment can only occur as a result of an explicit client update to the DeploymentConfig with a new LatestVersion. If null, defaults to having a config change trigger.   
`triggers[]` |  `object` |  DeploymentTriggerPolicy describes a policy for a single trigger that results in a new deployment.
