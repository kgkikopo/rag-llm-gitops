# 5.1. Specification

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`apiVersion` |  `string` |  APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources>  
`kind` |  `string` |  Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds>  
`metadata` |  [`ObjectMeta`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/common_object_reference/#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta) |  Standard object’s metadata. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata>  
`spec` |  `object` |  spec contains the desired kubelet configuration.   
`status` |  `object` |  status contains observed information about the kubelet configuration.

## 5.1.1. .spec

Description
     spec contains the desired kubelet configuration. 
Type
     `object`

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`autoSizingReserved` |  `boolean` |  autoSizingReserved controls whether system-reserved CPU and memory are automatically calculated based on each node’s installed capacity. When set to true, this prevents node failure from resource starvation of system components (kubelet, CRI-O) without manual configuration. When omitted, this means the user has no opinion and the platform is left to choose a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time. The current default is true for worker nodes and false for control plane nodes. When set to false, automatic resource reservation is disabled and manual settings must be configured.   
`kubeletConfig` |  ``  |  kubeletConfig contains upstream Kubernetes kubelet configuration fields. Values are validated by the kubelet itself. Invalid values may render nodes unusable. Refer to OpenShift documentation for the Kubernetes version corresponding to your OpenShift release to find valid kubelet configuration options.   
`logLevel` |  `integer` |  logLevel sets the kubelet log verbosity, controlling the amount of detail in kubelet logs. Valid values range from 0 (minimal logging) to 10 (maximum verbosity with trace-level detail). Higher log levels may impact node performance. When omitted, the platform chooses a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time. The current default is 2 (standard informational logging).   
`machineConfigPoolSelector` |  `object` |  machineConfigPoolSelector selects which pools the KubeletConfig should apply to. When omitted or set to an empty selector {}, no pools are selected, which is equivalent to not matching any MachineConfigPool.   
`tlsSecurityProfile` |  `object` |  tlsSecurityProfile configures TLS settings for the kubelet. When omitted, the TLS configuration defaults to the value from apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster. When specified, the type field can be set to either "Old", "Intermediate", "Modern", "Custom" or omitted for backward compatibility.

## 5.1.2. .spec.machineConfigPoolSelector

Description
     machineConfigPoolSelector selects which pools the KubeletConfig should apply to. When omitted or set to an empty selector {}, no pools are selected, which is equivalent to not matching any MachineConfigPool. 
Type
     `object`

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`matchExpressions` |  `array` |  matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.   
`matchExpressions[]` |  `object` |  A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.   
`matchLabels` |  `object (string)` |  matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

## 5.1.3. .spec.machineConfigPoolSelector.matchExpressions

Description
     matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. 
Type
     `array`

## 5.1.4. .spec.machineConfigPoolSelector.matchExpressions[]

Description
     A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values. 
Type
     `object`
Required
    

  * `key`
  * `operator`



Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`key` |  `string` |  key is the label key that the selector applies to.   
`operator` |  `string` |  operator represents a key’s relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.   
`values` |  `array (string)` |  values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

## 5.1.5. .spec.tlsSecurityProfile

Description
     tlsSecurityProfile configures TLS settings for the kubelet. When omitted, the TLS configuration defaults to the value from apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster. When specified, the type field can be set to either "Old", "Intermediate", "Modern", "Custom" or omitted for backward compatibility. 
Type
     `object`

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`custom` |  ``  |  custom is a user-defined TLS security profile. Be extremely careful using a custom profile as invalid configurations can be catastrophic. An example custom profile looks like this:  minTLSVersion: VersionTLS11 ciphers: - ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 - ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 - ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256   
`intermediate` |  ``  |  intermediate is a TLS profile for use when you do not need compatibility with legacy clients and want to remain highly secure while being compatible with most clients currently in use.  This profile is equivalent to a Custom profile specified as: minTLSVersion: VersionTLS12 ciphers: - TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 - ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 - ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 - ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 - ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305   
`modern` |  ``  |  modern is a TLS security profile for use with clients that support TLS 1.3 and do not need backward compatibility for older clients.  This profile is equivalent to a Custom profile specified as: minTLSVersion: VersionTLS13 ciphers: - TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256   
`old` |  ``  |  old is a TLS profile for use when services need to be accessed by very old clients or libraries and should be used only as a last resort.  This profile is equivalent to a Custom profile specified as: minTLSVersion: VersionTLS10 ciphers: - TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 - ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 - ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 - ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 - ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256 - ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA - ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA - ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA - AES128-GCM-SHA256 - AES256-GCM-SHA384 - AES128-SHA256 - AES128-SHA - AES256-SHA - DES-CBC3-SHA   
`type` |  `string` |  type is one of Old, Intermediate, Modern or Custom. Custom provides the ability to specify individual TLS security profile parameters.  The profiles are based on version 5.7 of the Mozilla Server Side TLS configuration guidelines. The cipher lists consist of the configuration’s "ciphersuites" followed by the Go-specific "ciphers" from the guidelines. See: <https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/guidelines/5.7.json> The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers are found to be insecure. Depending on precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be reduced.
