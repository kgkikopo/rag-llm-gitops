## 4.1.4. .spec.buildDefaults.defaultProxy

Description
    

defaultProxy contains the default proxy settings for all build operations, including image pull/push and source download. 

Values can be overrode by setting the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables in the build config’s strategy. 

Type
     `object`

Property| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`httpProxy` |  `string` |  httpProxy is the URL of the proxy for HTTP requests. Empty means unset and will not result in an env var.

`trustedCA` |  `object` |  trustedCA is a reference to a ConfigMap containing a CA certificate bundle. The trustedCA field should only be consumed by a proxy validator.

Clients that expect to make proxy connections must use the trusted-ca-bundle for all HTTPS requests to the proxy, and may use the trusted-ca-bundle for non-proxy HTTPS requests as well.  The namespace for the ConfigMap referenced by trustedCA is "openshift-config". Here is an example ConfigMap (in yaml):  apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: user-ca-bundle namespace: openshift-config data: ca-bundle.crt: | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- Custom CA certificate bundle. -----END CERTIFICATE-----
