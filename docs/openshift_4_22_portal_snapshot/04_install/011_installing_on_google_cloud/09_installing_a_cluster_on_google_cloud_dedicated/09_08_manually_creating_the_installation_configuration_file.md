# 9.8. Manually creating the installation configuration file

Installing the cluster requires that you manually create the installation configuration file. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have an SSH public key on your local machine for use with the installation program. You can use the key for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery. 
  * You have obtained the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in: 

```shell-session
$ mkdir <installation_directory>
```


Important

You must create a directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version. 

  2. Customize the provided sample `install-config.yaml` file template and save the file in the `<installation_directory>`. 

Note

You must name this configuration file `install-config.yaml`. 

  3. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use it to install many clusters. 

Important

Back up the `install-config.yaml` file now, because the installation process consumes the file in the next step.

## 9.8.1. Sample install-config.yaml file for Google Cloud Dedicated

You can configure disk types, encryption keys, and OS images specific to Google Cloud Dedicated (GCD) deployments in the `install-config.yaml` file. 

**Example`install-config.yaml` file for GCD**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
metadata:
  name: gcd-cluster
platform:
  gcp:
    projectID: eu0:my-project-id
    region: u-germany-northeast1
    defaultMachinePlatform:
      osDisk:
        diskType: hyperdisk-balanced
        encryptionKey:
          kmsKey:
            name: my-regional-key
            keyRing: my-key-ring
            location: u-germany-northeast1
            projectID: eu0:my-project-id
      osImage:
        project: eu0:my-project-id
        name: my-rhcos-image
publish: Internal
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
sshKey: 'ssh-rsa AAAA...'
```


where: 

`baseDomain`
     Specifies the base domain for your cluster. Use a domain that you control. 
`platform.gcp.projectID`
     Specifies the Google Cloud project ID for your GCD environment. This value must include the domain-scoped prefix, such as `eu0:my-project-id`. 
`platform.gcp.defaultMachinePlatform.osDisk.diskType`
     Specifies the disk type for machine storage. For GCD, this value must be `hyperdisk-balanced`. 
`platform.gcp.defaultMachinePlatform.osDisk.encryptionKey.kmsKey.name`
     Specifies the name of your regional KMS key. In GCD, global keys are not supported. 
`platform.gcp.defaultMachinePlatform.osImage.project`
     Specifies the Google Cloud project ID where your custom RHCOS image is stored. This value is required. The RHCOS image is not pre-published in GCD regions. 
`publish`
     Specifies the cluster publishing strategy. For GCD, you must use `Internal`. 
`pullSecret`
     Specifies your Red Hat pull secret. 
`sshKey`
     Specifies your SSH public key for accessing cluster nodes. 

Note

Before you use a custom RHCOS image, verify that it is compatible with your OpenShift Container Platform version and has been properly imported into your GCD project. 

## 9.8.2. Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

To ensure that your OpenShift Container Platform cluster runs as expected, each cluster machine must meet minimum CPU, memory, and storage requirements. 

Table 9.2. Minimum resource requirementsMachine| Operating system| vCPU| Virtual RAM| Storage| Input/Output Per Second (IOPS)  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Bootstrap  |  RHCOS  |  4  |  16 GB  |  100 GB  |  300   
Control plane  |  RHCOS  |  4  |  16 GB  |  100 GB  |  300   
Compute  |  RHCOS  |  2  |  8 GB  |  100 GB  |  300   
Show more

  * One vCPU is equal to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs. 
  * OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and Red Hat recommends faster storage, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. On many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to provision more storage to get enough performance. 
  * As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later do not support RHEL 7 compute machines. 



Note

In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.22, RHCOS uses RHEL version 9.8, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. Each architecture requires the following minimum instruction set architectures (ISA): 

  * x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA 
  * ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA 
  * ppc64le architecture requires IBM® Power9 ISA 
  * s390x architecture requires IBM® z14 ISA 



For more information, see [Architectures](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/9.8_release_notes/index#architectures) in the RHEL documentation. 

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in OpenShift Container Platform.

## 9.8.3. Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file. 
  * You have reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, the proxy handles all cluster egress traffic, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the `Proxy` object’s `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary. 

Note

The `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field includes the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration. 

For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field also includes the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`). 




**Procedure**

  1. Edit your `install-config.yaml` file and add the proxy settings. For example: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  noProxy: example.com
additionalTrustBundle: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle>
# ...
```


where: 

`proxy.httpProxy`
     Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`. 
`proxy.httpsProxy`
     Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. 
`proxy.noProxy`
     Specifies a comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 
`additionalTrustBundle`
     If you specify this value, the installation program generates a config map named `user-ca-bundle` in the `openshift-config` namespace to hold the additional CA certificates. If you specify `additionalTrustBundle` and at least one proxy setting, the `Proxy` object references the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The Cluster Network Operator then creates a `trusted-ca-bundle` config map that merges the contents specified for the `trustedCA` parameter with the RHCOS trust bundle. You must set the `additionalTrustBundle` field unless an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle signs the proxy’s identity certificate. 
`additionalTrustBundlePolicy`
    

Specifies the policy that determines the configuration of the `Proxy` object to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The allowed values are `Proxyonly` and `Always`. Use `Proxyonly` to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map only when you configure an `http/https` proxy. Use `Always` to always reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map. The default value is `Proxyonly`. Optional parameter. 

Note

The installation program does not support the proxy `readinessEndpoints` field. 

Note

If the installation program times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installation program. For example: 

```shell-session
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```


  2. Save the file and reference it when installing OpenShift Container Platform. 

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy named `cluster` that uses the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. If you do not give proxy settings, the installation program still creates a `cluster` `Proxy` object, but it has a nil `spec`. 

Note

Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and you cannot create additional proxies.
