# 2.2. Preparing to install a cluster on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE using user-provisioned infrastructure

Before installing OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE with user-provisioned infrastructure, you must verify connectivity, download the installation program, and prepare your pull secret and SSH key. 

  * Verifying internet connectivity for your cluster. 
  * Downloading the installation program. 

Note

If you are installing in a disconnected environment, you extract the installation program from the mirrored content. For more information, see Mirroring images for a disconnected installation in the Additional resources section. 

  * Installing the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). 

Note

If you are installing in a disconnected environment, install `oc` to the mirror host. 

  * Generating an SSH key pair. You can use this key pair to authenticate into the OpenShift Container Platform cluster’s nodes after it is deployed. 



  * Validating DNS resolution. 



## 2.2.1. Internet access for OpenShift Container Platform

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.22, you require access to the internet to install your cluster. 

You must have internet access to perform the following actions: 

  * Access Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster. 
  * Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster. 
  * Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates. 



Important

If your cluster cannot have direct internet access, you can perform a restricted network installation on some types of infrastructure that you provision. During that process, you download the required content and use it to populate a mirror registry with the installation packages. With some installation types, the environment that you install your cluster in will not require internet access. Before you update the cluster, you update the content of the mirror registry. 

## 2.2.2. Obtaining the installation program

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on your provisioning machine, so that installation assets exist for deployment in your environment. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have a machine that runs Linux, for example Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, with 500 MB of local disk space. 



**Procedure**

  1. Go to the [Cluster Type](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install) page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account. 

Tip

You can also [download the binaries for a specific OpenShift Container Platform release](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/). 

  2. Select your infrastructure provider from the **Run it yourself** section of the page. 
  3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under **OpenShift Installer** and click **Download Installer**. 
  4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files. 

Important

     * The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster. 
     * Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider. 

  5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```


  6. Download your installation [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret). This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for OpenShift Container Platform components. 

Tip

Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/), where you can specify a version of the installation program to download. However, you must have an active subscription to access this page. 




## 2.2.3. Install the OpenShift CLI on Linux

To manage your cluster and deploy applications from the command line on Linux, install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) binary. You can download the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) from the Red Customer Portal. 

Important

If you installed an earlier version of `oc`, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in OpenShift Container Platform. 

Download and install the new version of `oc`. 

**Procedure**

  1. Navigate to the [Download OpenShift Container Platform](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290) page on the Red Hat Customer Portal. 
  2. Select the architecture from the **Product Variant** list. 
  3. Select the appropriate version from the **Version** list. 
  4. Click **Download Now** next to the **OpenShift v4.22 Linux Clients** entry and save the file. 
  5. Unpack the archive: 

```shell-session
$ tar xvf <file>
```


  6. Place the `oc` binary in a directory that is on your `PATH`. 

To check your `PATH`, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ echo $PATH
```


**Verification**

  * After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the `oc` command: 

```shell-session
$ oc <command>
```


## 2.2.4. Install the OpenShift CLI on Windows

To manage your cluster and deploy applications from the command line on Windows, install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) binary. You can download the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) from the Red Customer Portal. 

Important

If you installed an earlier version of `oc`, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in OpenShift Container Platform. 

Download and install the new version of `oc`. 

**Procedure**

  1. Navigate to the [Download OpenShift Container Platform](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290) page on the Red Hat Customer Portal. 
  2. Select the appropriate version from the **Version** list. 
  3. Click **Download Now** next to the **OpenShift v4.22 Windows Client** entry and save the file. 
  4. Extract the archive with a ZIP program. 
  5. Move the `oc` binary to a directory that is on your `PATH` variable. 

To check your `PATH` variable, open the Command Prompt and run the following command: 

```shell-session
C:\> path
```


**Verification**

  * After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the `oc` command: 

```shell-session
C:\> oc <command>
```


## 2.2.5. Install the OpenShift CLI on macOS

To manage your cluster and deploy applications from the command line on macOS, install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) binary. You can download the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) from the Red Customer Portal. 

Important

If you installed an earlier version of `oc`, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in OpenShift Container Platform. 

Download and install the new version of `oc`. 

**Procedure**

  1. Navigate to the [Download OpenShift Container Platform](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290) page on the Red Hat Customer Portal. 
  2. Select the architecture from the **Product Variant** list. 
  3. Select the appropriate version from the **Version** list. 
  4. Click **Download Now** next to the **OpenShift v4.22 macOS Clients** entry and save the file. 

Note

For macOS arm64, choose the **OpenShift v4.22 macOS arm64 Client** entry. 

  5. Extract the archive. 
  6. Move the `oc` binary to a directory on your `PATH` variable. 

To check your `PATH` variable, open a terminal and run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ echo $PATH
```


**Verification**

  * Verify your installation by using an `oc` command: 

```shell-session
$ oc <command>
```


## 2.2.6. Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for the `core` user on each node. 

The key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list for the `core` user on each node, which enables password-less authentication. After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user `core`. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user. 

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The `./openshift-install gather` command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes. 

Important

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required. 

**Procedure**

  1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name>
```


Specifies the path and file name, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your `~/.ssh` directory. 

Note

If you plan to install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures, do not create a key that uses the `ed25519` algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the `rsa` or `ecdsa` algorithm. 

  2. View the public SSH key: 

```shell-session
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` public key: 

```shell-session
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```


  3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the `./openshift-install gather` command. 

Note

On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_dsa` are managed automatically. 

     1. If the `ssh-agent` process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task: 

```shell-session
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
Agent pid 31874
```


Note

If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA. 

  4. Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`: 

```shell-session
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name>
```


Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. 

**Example output**

```shell-session
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


**Next steps**

  * When you install OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program. 



## 2.2.7. Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure

To prevent network-related installation failures and ensure node connectivity in OpenShift Container Platform, validate your DNS configuration before deploying on user-provisioned infrastructure. 

Important

The validation steps detailed in this section must succeed before you install your cluster. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have configured the required DNS records for your user-provisioned infrastructure. 



**Procedure**

  1. From your installation node, run DNS lookups against the record names of the Kubernetes API, the wildcard routes, and the cluster nodes. Validate that the IP addresses contained in the responses correspond to the correct components. 

     1. Perform a lookup against the Kubernetes API record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the API load balancer: 

```shell-session
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```


Replace `<nameserver_ip>` with the IP address of the name server, `<cluster_name>` with your cluster name, and `<base_domain>` with your base domain name. 

**Example output**

```shell-session
api.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
```


     2. Perform a lookup against the Kubernetes internal API record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the API load balancer: 

```shell-session
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
api-int.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
```


     3. Test an example `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` DNS wildcard lookup. All of the application wildcard lookups must resolve to the IP address of the application ingress load balancer: 

```shell-session
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> random.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
random.apps.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
```


Note

In the example outputs, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation. 

You can replace `random` with another wildcard value. For example, you can query the route to the OpenShift Container Platform console: 

```shell-session
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.com. 604800 IN	A 192.168.1.5
```


     4. Run a lookup against the bootstrap DNS record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the bootstrap node: 

```shell-session
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> bootstrap.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
bootstrap.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.96
```


     5. Use this method to perform lookups against the DNS record names for the control plane and compute nodes. Check that the results correspond to the IP addresses of each node. 

  2. From your installation node, run reverse DNS lookups against the IP addresses of the load balancer and the cluster nodes. Validate that the record names contained in the responses correspond to the correct components. 

     1. Perform a reverse lookup against the IP address of the API load balancer. Check that the response includes the record names for the Kubernetes API and the Kubernetes internal API: 

```shell-session
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> -x 192.168.1.5
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
5.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	api-int.ocp4.example.com.
5.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	api.ocp4.example.com.
```


where: 

`api-int.ocp4.example.com`
     Specifies the record name for the Kubernetes internal API. 
`api.ocp4.example.com`
    

Specifies the record name for the Kubernetes API. 

Note

A PTR record is not required for the OpenShift Container Platform application wildcard. No validation step is needed for reverse DNS resolution against the IP address of the application ingress load balancer. 

     2. Perform a reverse lookup against the IP address of the bootstrap node. Check that the result points to the DNS record name of the bootstrap node: 

```shell-session
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> -x 192.168.1.96
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
96.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	bootstrap.ocp4.example.com.
```


     3. Use this method to perform reverse lookups against the IP addresses for the control plane and compute nodes. Check that the results correspond to the DNS record names of each node.
