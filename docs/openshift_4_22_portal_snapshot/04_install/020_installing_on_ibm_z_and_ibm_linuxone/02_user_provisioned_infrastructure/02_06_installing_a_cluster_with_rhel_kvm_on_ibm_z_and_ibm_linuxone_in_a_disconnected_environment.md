# 2.6. Installing a cluster with RHEL KVM on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE in a disconnected environment

You can install OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE by using RHEL KVM on infrastructure that you provision in a disconnected environment, using an internal mirror of the installation release content. 

Note

While this document refers to only IBM Z®, all information in it also applies to IBM® LinuxONE. 

## 2.6.1. Prerequisites for installing a cluster on IBM Z with RHEL in a disconnected environment

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Z® with RHEL KVM by using user-provisioned infrastructure in a disconnected environment, you must complete prerequisite tasks that prepare your KVM host, mirrored registry, storage, and network environment. 

  * You have completed the tasks in preparing to install a cluster on IBM Z® using user-provisioned infrastructure. 
  * You reviewed details about the OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes. 
  * You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users. 
  * You mirrored the images for a disconnected installation to your registry and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of OpenShift Container Platform. 
  * Before you begin the installation process, you must move or remove any existing installation files. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process. 

Important

Ensure that installation steps are done from a machine with access to the installation media. 

  * You provisioned persistent storage by using OpenShift Data Foundation or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with `ReadWriteMany` access. 
  * If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to. 

Note

Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy. 

  * You provisioned a RHEL Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) system that is hosted on the logical partition (LPAR) and based on RHEL 8.6 or later. See [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#RHEL8_and_9_Life_Cycle).

## 2.6.2. About installations in restricted networks

You can install OpenShift Container Platform 4.22 in a restricted network that lacks an active internet connection. These restricted installations use installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure, depending on your cloud platform. 

If you choose to perform a restricted network installation on a cloud platform, you still require access to its cloud APIs. Some cloud functions, such as Amazon Web Service’s Route 53 DNS and IAM services, require internet access. Depending on your network, you might require less internet access for an installation on bare-metal hardware, Nutanix, or on VMware vSphere. 

To complete a restricted network installation, you must create a registry that mirrors the contents of the OpenShift image registry and contains the installation media. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can access both the internet and your closed network, or by using other methods that meet your restrictions. 

Important

Because of the complexity of the configuration for user-provisioned installations, consider completing a standard user-provisioned infrastructure installation before you try a restricted network installation using user-provisioned infrastructure. Completing this test installation might make it easier to isolate and troubleshoot any issues that might arise during your installation in a restricted network. 

### 2.6.2.1. Additional limits

Clusters in restricted networks have the following additional limitations and restrictions: 

  * The `ClusterVersion` status includes an `Unable to retrieve available updates` error. 
  * By default, you cannot use the contents of the Developer Catalog because you cannot access the required image stream tags. 



## 2.6.3. Preparing the user-provisioned infrastructure

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure, you must prepare the underlying infrastructure. 

This section provides details about the high-level steps required to set up your cluster infrastructure in preparation for an OpenShift Container Platform installation. This includes configuring IP networking and network connectivity for your cluster nodes, enabling the required ports through your firewall, and setting up the required DNS and load balancing infrastructure. 

After preparation, your cluster infrastructure must meet the requirements outlined in the _Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure_ section. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have reviewed the [OpenShift Container Platform 4.x Tested Integrations](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4128421) page. 
  * You have reviewed the infrastructure requirements detailed in the _Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure_ section. 



**Procedure**

  1. If you are using DHCP to provide the IP networking configuration to your cluster nodes, configure your DHCP service. 

     1. Add persistent IP addresses for the nodes to your DHCP server configuration. In your configuration, match the MAC address of the relevant network interface to the intended IP address for each node. 
     2. When you use DHCP to configure IP addressing for the cluster machines, the machines also obtain the DNS server information through DHCP. Define the persistent DNS server address that is used by the cluster nodes through your DHCP server configuration. 

Note

If you are not using a DHCP service, you must provide the IP networking configuration and the address of the DNS server to the nodes at RHCOS install time. These can be passed as boot arguments if you are installing from an ISO image. See the _Installing RHCOS and starting the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process_ section for more information about static IP provisioning and advanced networking options. 

     3. Define the hostnames of your cluster nodes in your DHCP server configuration. See the _Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP_ section for details about hostname considerations. 

Note

If you are not using a DHCP service, the cluster nodes obtain their hostname through a reverse DNS lookup. 

  2. Choose to perform either a fast track installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) or a full installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS). For the full installation, you must set up an HTTP or HTTPS server to provide Ignition files and install images to the cluster nodes. For the fast track installation an HTTP or HTTPS server is not required, however, a DHCP server is required. See sections “Fast-track installation: Creating Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines" and “Full installation: Creating Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines". 
  3. Ensure that your network infrastructure provides the required network connectivity between the cluster components. See the _Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure_ section for details about the requirements. 
  4. Configure your firewall to enable the ports required for the OpenShift Container Platform cluster components to communicate. See _Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure_ section for details about the ports that are required. 

Important

By default, port `1936` is accessible for an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, because each control plane node needs access to this port. 

For ingress health check probes, the `/healthz/ready` endpoint is available on this port. 

Avoid using the Ingress load balancer to expose this port, because doing so might result in the exposure of sensitive information, such as statistics and metrics, related to Ingress Controllers. 

  5. Setup the required DNS infrastructure for your cluster. 

     1. Configure DNS name resolution for the Kubernetes API, the application wildcard, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines. 
     2. Configure reverse DNS resolution for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines. 

See the _User-provisioned DNS requirements_ section for more information about the OpenShift Container Platform DNS requirements. 

  6. Validate your DNS configuration. 

     1. From your installation node, run DNS lookups against the record names of the Kubernetes API, the wildcard routes, and the cluster nodes. Validate that the IP addresses in the responses correspond to the correct components. 
     2. From your installation node, run reverse DNS lookups against the IP addresses of the load balancer and the cluster nodes. Validate that the record names in the responses correspond to the correct components. 

See the _Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure_ section for detailed DNS validation steps. 

  7. Provision the required API and application ingress load balancing infrastructure. See the _Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure_ section for more information about the requirements. 

Note

Some load balancing solutions require the DNS name resolution for the cluster nodes to be in place before the load balancing is initialized. 




### 2.6.3.1. Example load balancer configuration for user-provisioned clusters

Reference the example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration so that you can understand how to meet the load balancing requirements for user-provisioned clusters. 

The sample is an `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another. 

Tip

If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer, you can check that the `haproxy` process is listening on ports `6443`, `22623`, `443`, and `80` by running `netstat -nltupe` on the HAProxy node. 

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation. 

Note

If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer and SELinux is set to `enforcing`, you must ensure that the HAProxy service can bind to the configured TCP port by running `setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any=1`.

```


where: 

`listen api-server-6443`
     Port `6443` handles the Kubernetes API traffic and points to the control plane machines. You must configure health checks on this port to ensure that the API server is available before routing traffic. 
`server bootstrap bootstrap.ocp4.example.com`
     The bootstrap entries must be in place before the OpenShift Container Platform cluster installation and they must be removed after the bootstrap process is complete. 
`listen machine-config-server`
     Port `22623` handles the machine config server traffic and points to the control plane machines. 
`listen ingress-router-443`
     Port `443` handles the HTTPS traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default. 
`listen ingress-router-80`
    

Port `80` handles the HTTP traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default. 

Note

If you are deploying a compact three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes. 

## 2.6.4. Manually creating the installation configuration file

Installing the cluster requires that you manually create the installation configuration file. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have an SSH public key on your local machine for use with the installation program. You can use the key for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery. 
  * You have obtained the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in: 

```shell-session
$ mkdir <installation_directory>
```


Important

You must create a directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version. 

  2. Customize the provided sample `install-config.yaml` file template and save the file in the `<installation_directory>`. 

Note

You must name this configuration file `install-config.yaml`. 

  3. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use it to install many clusters. 

Important

Back up the `install-config.yaml` file now, because the installation process consumes the file in the next step.

### 2.6.4.1. Sample install-config.yaml file for IBM Z

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about your OpenShift Container Platform cluster platform or modify the values of the required parameters. 

```yaml

  source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
```


where: 

`baseDomain`
     Specifies the base domain of the cluster. All DNS records must be sub-domains of this base and include the cluster name. 
`compute`
     Specifies the `compute` node configurations, which is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`. 
`controlPlane`
     Specifies the `controlPlane` node configurations, which is a single mapping. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Only one control plane pool is used. 
`hyperthreading`
     Specifies whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading. By default, SMT is enabled to increase the performance of the cores in your machines. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable SMT, you must disable it in all cluster machines; this includes both control plane and compute machines. 

Note

Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is enabled by default. If SMT is not available on your OpenShift Container Platform nodes, the `hyperthreading` parameter has no effect. 

Important

If you disable `hyperthreading`, whether on your OpenShift Container Platform nodes or in the `install-config.yaml` file, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance. 

`compute.replicas`
     Specifies the number of compute machines that the cluster creates and manages for you on installer-provisioned installations. You must set this value to `0` when you install OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure. Additionally for user-provisioned installations, you must manually deploy the compute machines before you finish installing the cluster. 

Note

If you are installing a three-node cluster, do not deploy any compute machines when you install the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines. 

`controlPlane.replicas`
     Specifies the number of control plane machines that you add to the cluster. Because the cluster uses these values as the number of etcd endpoints in the cluster, the value must match the number of control plane machines that you deploy. 
`metadata.name`
     Specifies the cluster name that you specified in your DNS records. 
`networking.clusterNetwork.cidr`
     Specifies a block of IP addresses from which pod IP addresses are allocated. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. These IP addresses are used for the pod network. If you need to access the pods from an external network, you must configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic. 

Note

Class E CIDR range is reserved for a future use. To use the Class E CIDR range, you must ensure your networking environment accepts the IP addresses within the Class E CIDR range. 

`networking.cidr.hostPrefix`
     Specifies the subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if `hostPrefix` is set to `23`, then each node is assigned a `/23` subnet out of the given `cidr`, which allows for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses. If you are required to provide access to nodes from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic. 
`networking.networkType`
     Specifies the cluster network plugin to install. The default value `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported value. 
`networking.serviceNetwork`
     Specifies the IP address pool to use for service IP addresses. You can enter only one IP address pool. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. If you need to access the services from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic. 
`platform`
     Specifies the platform. You must set the platform to `none`. You cannot provide additional platform configuration variables for IBM Z® infrastructure. 

Important

Clusters that are installed with the platform type `none` are unable to use some features, such as managing compute machines with the Machine API. This limitation applies even if the compute machines that are attached to the cluster are installed on a platform that would normally support the feature. This parameter cannot be changed after installation. 

`fips`
     Specifies either enabling or disabling FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead. 

Important

To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see [Switching RHEL to FIPS mode](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/switching-rhel-to-fips-mode_security-hardening). 

When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures. 

`pullSecret`
     Specifies the registry domain name for `<local_registry>`, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content. For example, `registry.example.com` or `registry.example.com:5000`. For `<credentials>`, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for your mirror registry. 
`sshKey`
     Specifies the SSH public key for the `core` user in Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS). 

Note

For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses. 

`additionalTrustBundle`
     Specifies the `additionalTrustBundle` parameter and value. The value must be the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry. The certificate file can be an existing, trusted certificate authority or the self-signed certificate that you generated for the mirror registry. 
`imageContentSources`
     Specifies the `imageContentSources` section according to the output of the command that you used to mirror the repository. 

Important

  * When using the `oc adm release mirror` command, use the output from the `imageContentSources` section. 
  * When using `oc mirror` command, use the `repositoryDigestMirrors` section of the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` file that results from running the command. 
  * `ImageContentSourcePolicy` is deprecated. For more information see _Configuring image registry repository mirroring_. 



### 2.6.4.2. Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file. 
  * You have reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, the proxy handles all cluster egress traffic, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the `Proxy` object’s `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary. 

Note

The `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field includes the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration. 

For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field also includes the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`). 




**Procedure**

  1. Edit your `install-config.yaml` file and add the proxy settings. For example: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  noProxy: example.com
additionalTrustBundle: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle>
# ...
```


where: 

`proxy.httpProxy`
     Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`. 
`proxy.httpsProxy`
     Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. 
`proxy.noProxy`
     Specifies a comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 
`additionalTrustBundle`
     If you specify this value, the installation program generates a config map named `user-ca-bundle` in the `openshift-config` namespace to hold the additional CA certificates. If you specify `additionalTrustBundle` and at least one proxy setting, the `Proxy` object references the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The Cluster Network Operator then creates a `trusted-ca-bundle` config map that merges the contents specified for the `trustedCA` parameter with the RHCOS trust bundle. You must set the `additionalTrustBundle` field unless an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle signs the proxy’s identity certificate. 
`additionalTrustBundlePolicy`
    

Specifies the policy that determines the configuration of the `Proxy` object to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The allowed values are `Proxyonly` and `Always`. Use `Proxyonly` to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map only when you configure an `http/https` proxy. Use `Always` to always reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map. The default value is `Proxyonly`. Optional parameter. 

Note

The installation program does not support the proxy `readinessEndpoints` field. 

Note

If the installation program times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installation program. For example: 

```shell-session
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```


  2. Save the file and reference it when installing OpenShift Container Platform. 

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy named `cluster` that uses the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. If you do not give proxy settings, the installation program still creates a `cluster` `Proxy` object, but it has a nil `spec`. 

Note

Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and you cannot create additional proxies. 




### 2.6.4.3. Configuring a three-node cluster

To create smaller, resource-efficient clusters for testing and production, deploy a bare-metal cluster with zero compute machines in a minimal three-node cluster. This optional configuration uses only three control plane machines, optimizing infrastructure resources for testing, development, and production purposes. 

In three-node OpenShift Container Platform environments, the three control plane machines are schedulable, which means that your application workloads run on them. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file. 



**Procedure**

  * Ensure that the number of compute replicas is set to `0` in your `install-config.yaml` file, as shown in the following `compute` stanza: 

```yaml
compute:
- name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 0
# ...
```


Note

You must set the value of the `replicas` parameter for the compute machines to `0` when you install OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure, regardless of the number of compute machines you deploy. In installer-provisioned installations, the parameter controls the number of compute machines that the cluster creates and manages for you. This does not apply to user-provisioned installations, where you deploy the compute machines manually. 

Note

The preferred resource for control plane nodes is six vCPUs and 21 GB. For three control plane nodes this is the memory + vCPU equivalent of a minimum five-node cluster. Back the three nodes, each installed on a 120 GB disk, with three IFLs that are SMT2 enabled. The minimum tested setup is three vCPUs and 10 GB on a 120 GB disk for each control plane node. 




For three-node cluster installations, follow these next steps: 

  * If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes. See the _Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure_ section for more information. 
  * When you create the Kubernetes manifest files in the following procedure, ensure that the `mastersSchedulable` parameter in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` file is set to `true`. This enables your application workloads to run on the control plane nodes. 
  * Do not deploy any compute nodes when you create the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines. 



## 2.6.5. Cluster Network Operator configuration

To manage cluster networking, configure the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) `Network` custom resource (CR) named `cluster` so the cluster uses the correct IP ranges and network plugin settings for reliable pod and service connectivity. 

Some settings and fields are inherited at the time of install or by the `default.Network.type` plugin, OVN-Kubernetes. 

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the `Network` API in the `Network.config.openshift.io` API group: 

`clusterNetwork`
     IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated. 
`serviceNetwork`
     IP address pool for services. 
`defaultNetwork.type`
     Cluster network plugin. `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported plugin during installation. 

You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the `defaultNetwork` object in the CNO object named `cluster`. 

### 2.6.5.1. Cluster Network Operator configuration object

The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table: 

Table 2.43. Cluster Network Operator configuration objectField| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`metadata.name` |  `string` |  The name of the CNO object. This name is always `cluster`.   
`spec.clusterNetwork` |  `array` |  A list specifying the blocks of IP addresses from which pod IP addresses are allocated and the subnet prefix length assigned to each individual node in the cluster. If you use dual-stack networking, specify IPv4 and IPv6 address families. For example:  `spec: clusterNetwork: - cidr: 10.128.0.0/19 hostPrefix: 23 - cidr: fd01::/48 hostPrefix: 64` If you install a cluster on AWS with dual-stack networking, the order of addresses must match the dual-stack configuration you selected. For example, if you specified the `DualStackIPv4Primary`, list the IPv4 address first.   
`spec.serviceNetwork` |  `array` |  A block of IP addresses for services. If you use dual-stack networking, specify IPv4 and IPv6 address families. For example:  `spec: serviceNetwork: - 172.30.0.0/14 - fd02::/112` If you install a cluster on AWS with dual-stack networking, the order of addresses must match the dual-stack configuration you selected. For example, if you specified the `DualStackIPv4Primary`, list the IPv4 address first.  You can customize this field only in the `install-config.yaml` file before you create the manifests. The value is read-only in the manifest file.   
`spec.defaultNetwork` |  `object` |  Configures the network plugin for the cluster network.   
`spec.additionalRoutingCapabilities.providers` |  `array` |  This setting enables a dynamic routing provider. The FRR routing capability provider is required for the route advertisement feature. The only supported value is `FRR`. 

  * `FRR`: The FRR routing provider 

`spec: additionalRoutingCapabilities: providers: - FRR`  
Show more

Important

For a cluster that needs to deploy objects across multiple networks, ensure that you specify the same value for the `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` parameter for each network type that is defined in the `install-config.yaml` file. Setting a different value for each `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` parameter can impact the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, where the plugin cannot effectively route object traffic among different nodes. 

### 2.6.5.2. defaultNetwork object configuration

The values for the `defaultNetwork` object are defined in the following table: 

Table 2.44. defaultNetwork objectField| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`type` |  `string` |  `OVNKubernetes`. The Red Hat OpenShift Networking network plugin is selected during installation. This value cannot be changed after cluster installation.  Note OpenShift Container Platform uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin by default.   
`ovnKubernetesConfig` |  `object` |  This object is only valid for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.   
Show more

### 2.6.5.3. Configuration for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

The following table describes the configuration fields for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin: 

Table 2.45. ovnKubernetesConfig objectField| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`mtu` |  `integer` |  The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) overlay network. This is detected automatically based on the MTU of the primary network interface. You do not normally need to override the detected MTU.  If the auto-detected value is not what you expect it to be, confirm that the MTU on the primary network interface on your nodes is correct. You cannot use this option to change the MTU value of the primary network interface on the nodes.  If your cluster requires different MTU values for different nodes, you must set this value to `100` less than the lowest MTU value in your cluster. For example, if some nodes in your cluster have an MTU of `9001`, and some have an MTU of `1500`, you must set this value to `1400`.   
`genevePort` |  `integer` |  The port to use for all Geneve packets. The default value is `6081`. This value cannot be changed after cluster installation.   
`ipsecConfig` |  `object` |  Specify a configuration object for customizing the IPsec configuration.   
`ipv4` |  `object` |  Specifies a configuration object for IPv4 settings.   
`ipv6` |  `object` |  Specifies a configuration object for IPv6 settings.   
`policyAuditConfig` |  `object` |  Specify a configuration object for customizing network policy audit logging. If unset, the defaults audit log settings are used.   
`routeAdvertisements` |  `string` |  Specifies whether to advertise cluster network routes. The default value is `Disabled`. 

  * `Enabled`: Import routes to the cluster network and advertise cluster network routes as configured in `RouteAdvertisements` objects. 
  * `Disabled`: Do not import routes to the cluster network or advertise cluster network routes. 

  
`gatewayConfig` |  `object` |  Optional: Specify a configuration object for customizing how egress traffic is sent to the node gateway. Valid values are `Shared` and `Local`. The default value is `Shared`. In the default setting, the Open vSwitch (OVS) outputs traffic directly to the node IP interface. If you are using hardware offloading, Red Hat recommends to use the default `Shared` gateway mode to bypass the host routing plane. In the `Local` setting, it traverses the host network; consequently, it gets applied to the routing table of the host.  Note While migrating egress traffic, you can expect some disruption to workloads and service traffic until the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) successfully rolls out the changes.

Table 2.46. ovnKubernetesConfig.ipv4 objectField| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`internalTransitSwitchSubnet` |  string  |  If your existing network infrastructure overlaps with the `100.88.0.0/16` IPv4 subnet, you can specify a different IP address range for internal use by OVN-Kubernetes. The subnet for the distributed transit switch that enables east-west traffic. This subnet cannot overlap with any other subnets used by OVN-Kubernetes or on the host itself. It must be large enough to accommodate one IP address per node in your cluster.  The default value is `100.88.0.0/16`.   
`internalJoinSubnet` |  string  |  If your existing network infrastructure overlaps with the `100.64.0.0/16` IPv4 subnet, you can specify a different IP address range for internal use by OVN-Kubernetes. You must ensure that the IP address range does not overlap with any other subnet used by your OpenShift Container Platform installation. The IP address range must be larger than the maximum number of nodes that can be added to the cluster. For example, if the `clusterNetwork.cidr` value is `10.128.0.0/14` and the `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` value is `/23`, then the maximum number of nodes is `2^(23-14)=512`.  The default value is `100.64.0.0/16`.   
Show more

Table 2.47. ovnKubernetesConfig.ipv6 objectField| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`internalTransitSwitchSubnet` |  string  |  If your existing network infrastructure overlaps with the `fd97::/64` IPv6 subnet, you can specify a different IP address range for internal use by OVN-Kubernetes. The subnet for the distributed transit switch that enables east-west traffic. This subnet cannot overlap with any other subnets used by OVN-Kubernetes or on the host itself. It must be large enough to accommodate one IP address per node in your cluster.  The default value is `fd97::/64`.   
`internalJoinSubnet` |  string  |  If your existing network infrastructure overlaps with the `fd98::/64` IPv6 subnet, you can specify a different IP address range for internal use by OVN-Kubernetes. You must ensure that the IP address range does not overlap with any other subnet used by your OpenShift Container Platform installation. The IP address range must be larger than the maximum number of nodes that can be added to the cluster.  The default value is `fd98::/64`.   
Show more

Table 2.48. policyAuditConfig objectField| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`rateLimit` |  integer  |  The maximum number of messages to generate every second per node. The default value is `20` messages per second.   
`maxFileSize` |  integer  |  The maximum size for the audit log in bytes. The default value is `50000000` or 50 MB.   
`maxLogFiles` |  integer  |  The maximum number of log files that are retained.   
`destination` |  string  |  One of the following additional audit log targets: 

`libc`
     The libc `syslog()` function of the journald process on the host. 
`udp:<host>:<port>`
     A syslog server. Replace `<host>:<port>` with the host and port of the syslog server. 
`unix:<file>`
     A UNIX Domain Socket file specified by `<file>`. 
`null`
     Do not send the audit logs to any additional target.   
`syslogFacility` |  string  |  The syslog facility, such as `kern`, as defined by RFC5424. The default value is `local0`.   
Show more

Table 2.49. gatewayConfig objectField| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`routingViaHost` |  `boolean` |  Set this field to `true` to send egress traffic from pods to the host networking stack. For highly-specialized installations and applications that rely on manually configured routes in the kernel routing table, you might want to route egress traffic to the host networking stack. By default, egress traffic is processed in OVN to exit the cluster and is not affected by specialized routes in the kernel routing table. The default value is `false`.  This field has an interaction with the Open vSwitch hardware offloading feature. If you set this field to `true`, you do not receive the performance benefits of the offloading because egress traffic is processed by the host networking stack.   
`ipForwarding` |  `object` |  You can control IP forwarding for all traffic on OVN-Kubernetes managed interfaces by using the `ipForwarding` specification in the `Network` resource. Specify `Restricted` to only allow IP forwarding for Kubernetes related traffic. Specify `Global` to allow forwarding of all IP traffic. For new installations, the default is `Restricted`. For updates to OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 or later, the default is `Global`.  Note The default value of `Restricted` sets the IP forwarding to drop.   
`ipv4` |  `object` |  Optional: Specify an object to configure the internal OVN-Kubernetes masquerade address for host to service traffic for IPv4 addresses.   
`ipv6` |  `object` |  Optional: Specify an object to configure the internal OVN-Kubernetes masquerade address for host to service traffic for IPv6 addresses.

Important For OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 and later versions, clusters use `fd69::/112` as the default masquerade subnet. For upgraded clusters, there is no change to the default masquerade subnet.   
Show more

Table 2.52. ipsecConfig objectField| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`mode` |  `string` |  Specifies the behavior of the IPsec implementation. Must be one of the following values:

    ipsecConfig:
      mode: Full
```


## 2.6.6. Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files

Because you manually provision infrastructure, you must generate the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files that the cluster requires. 

The installation program converts the installation configuration into Kubernetes manifests and then wraps them into Ignition configuration files. You use these Ignition files to configure the cluster machines. 

Important

  * The Ignition config files that the OpenShift Container Platform installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which the system then renews. If you shut down the cluster before the system renews the certificates and you later restart the cluster after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for _Recovering from expired control plane certificates_ for more information. 
  * Use Ignition config files within 12 hours after you generate them, because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after you install the cluster. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation. 



Note

The installation program that generates the manifest and Ignition files is architecture specific. You can obtain it from the [client image mirror](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/s390x/clients/ocp/latest/). The Linux version of the installation program runs on s390x only. This installation program is also available as a macOS version. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You obtained the OpenShift Container Platform installation program. For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host. 
  * You created the `install-config.yaml` installation configuration file. 



**Procedure**

  1. Change to the directory that contains the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster: 

```shell-session
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where: 

`<installation_directory>`
     Specifies the installation directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file you created. 

Warning

If you are installing a three-node cluster, skip the following step to allow the control plane nodes to be schedulable. 

\+ 

Important

When you configure control plane nodes from the default unschedulable to schedulable, you require additional subscriptions because control plane nodes then become compute nodes. 

  2. Verify that the `mastersSchedulable` parameter in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` Kubernetes manifest file is set to `false`. This setting prevents pods from being scheduled on the control plane machines: 

     1. Open the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` file. 
     2. Locate the `mastersSchedulable` parameter and verify that it is set to `false`. 
     3. Save and exit the file. 

  3. To create the Ignition configuration files, run the following command from the directory that contains the installation program: 

```shell-session
$ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir <installation_directory>
```


where: 

`<installation_directory>`
    

Specifies the same installation directory. 

The installation program creates Ignition config files for the bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes in the installation directory. The program also creates the `kubeadmin-password` and `kubeconfig` files in the `./<installation_directory>/auth` directory: 

```plaintext
.
├── auth
│   ├── kubeadmin-password
│   └── kubeconfig
├── bootstrap.ign
├── master.ign
├── metadata.json
└── worker.ign
```


## 2.6.7. Installing RHCOS and starting the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process

To install OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Z® infrastructure that you provision, you install Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) guest virtual machines by using either a prepackaged QCOW2 image or a full installation on a new disk image. 

When you install RHCOS, you must provide the Ignition config file that was generated by the OpenShift Container Platform installation program for the type of machine you are installing. If you have configured suitable networking, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure, the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process begins automatically after the RHCOS machines have rebooted. 

You can perform a fast-track installation of RHCOS that uses a prepackaged QEMU copy-on-write (QCOW2) disk image. Alternatively, you can perform a full installation on a new QCOW2 disk image. 

To add further security to your system, you can optionally install RHCOS using IBM® Secure Execution before proceeding to the fast-track installation. 

### 2.6.7.1. Configuring encryption for nodes in an IBM Z or IBM LinuxONE environment

When installing OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE with RHEL KVM, you can optionally encrypt the boot volumes of your control plane and compute nodes by using one of the following methods. 

  * IBM® Secure Execution 
  * Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) encryption via IBM® Crypto Express (CEX) 
  * Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) 



#### 2.6.7.1.1. Installing RHCOS using IBM Secure Execution

You can install RHCOS using IBM® Secure Execution to run nodes as protected guests, isolating workloads from the host system. Before you begin, you must prepare the underlying infrastructure and verify hardware and software prerequisites. 

**Prerequisites**

  * IBM® z15 or later, or IBM® LinuxONE III or later. 
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 or later. 
  * You have a bootstrap Ignition file. The file is not protected, enabling others to view and edit it. 
  * You have verified that the boot image has not been altered after installation. 
  * You must run all your nodes as IBM® Secure Execution guests. 



**Procedure**

  1. Prepare your RHEL KVM host to support IBM® Secure Execution. 

     * By default, KVM hosts do not support guests in IBM® Secure Execution mode. To support guests in IBM® Secure Execution mode, KVM hosts must boot in LPAR mode with the kernel parameter specification `prot_virt=1`. To enable `prot_virt=1` on RHEL 8, follow these steps: 

       1. Navigate to `/boot/loader/entries/` to modify your boot loader configuration file `*.conf`. 
       2. Add the kernel command line parameter `prot_virt=1`. 
       3. Run the `zipl` command and reboot your system. 

KVM hosts that successfully start with support for IBM® Secure Execution for Linux issue the following kernel message: 

```shell-session
prot_virt: Reserving <amount>MB as ultravisor base storage.
```


       4. To verify that the KVM host now supports IBM® Secure Execution, run the following command: 

```shell-session
# cat /sys/firmware/uv/prot_virt_host
```


For example: 

```shell-session
1
```


The value of this attribute is 1 for Linux instances that detect their environment as consistent with that of a secure host. For other instances, the value is 0. 

  2. Add your host keys to the KVM guest via Ignition. 

During the first boot, RHCOS looks for your host keys to re-encrypt itself with them. RHCOS searches for files starting with `ibm-z-hostkey-` in the `/etc/se-hostkeys` directory. All host keys, for each machine the cluster is running on, must be loaded into the directory by the administrator. After first boot, you cannot run the VM on any other machines. 

Note

You need to prepare your Ignition file on a safe system. For example, another IBM® Secure Execution guest. 

For example: 

````shell-session
{
  "ignition": { "version": "3.0.0" },
  "storage": {
    "files": [
      {
        "path": "/etc/se-hostkeys/ibm-z-hostkey-<your-hostkey>.crt",
        "contents": {
          "source": "<base64_data_uri>"
        },
        "mode": 420
      },
      {
        "path": "/etc/se-hostkeys/ibm-z-hostkey-<your-hostkey>.crt",
        "contents": {
          "source": "<base64_data_uri>"
        },
        "mode": 420
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
````


Replace `<base64_data_uri>` with an Ignition data URI containing the Base64 encoded host key document. 

Note

You can add as many host keys as needed if you want your node to be able to run on multiple IBM Z® machines. 

  3. To generate the Base64 encoded string, run the following command: 

```shell-session
base64 <your-hostkey>.crt
```


Compared to guests not running IBM® Secure Execution, the first boot of the machine is longer because the entire image is encrypted with a randomly generated LUKS passphrase before the Ignition phase. 

  4. Add Ignition protection 

To protect the secrets that are stored in the Ignition config file from being read or even modified, you must encrypt the Ignition config file. 

Note

To achieve the desired security, Ignition logging and local login are disabled by default when running IBM® Secure Execution. 

     1. Fetch the public GPG key for the `secex-qemu.qcow2` image and encrypt the Ignition config with the key by running the following command: 

```shell-session
gpg --recipient-file /path/to/ignition.gpg.pub --yes --output /path/to/config.ign.gpg --verbose --armor --encrypt /path/to/config.ign
```


  5. Follow the fast-track installation of RHCOS to install nodes by using the IBM® Secure Execution QCOW image. 

Note

Before you start the VM, replace `serial=ignition` with `serial=ignition_crypted`, and add the `launchSecurity` parameter. 




**Verification**

When you have completed the fast-track installation of RHCOS and Ignition runs at the first boot, verify if decryption is successful. 

  * If the decryption is successful, you can expect an output similar to the following example: 

```shell-session
[    2.801433] systemd[1]: Starting coreos-ignition-setup-user.service - CoreOS Ignition User Config Setup...

[    2.803959] coreos-secex-ignition-decrypt[731]: gpg: key <key_name>: public key "Secure Execution (secex) 38.20230323.dev.0" imported

```


  * If the decryption fails, you can expect an output similar to the following example: 

```shell-session

#### 2.6.7.1.2. LUKS encryption via CEX in an IBM Z or IBM LinuxONE environment

Enabling hardware-based Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) encryption via IBM® Crypto Express (CEX) in an IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE environment requires additional steps. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have installed the `butane` utility. 
  * You have reviewed the instructions for how to create machine configs with Butane. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create Butane configuration files for the control plane and compute nodes: 

     * Create a file named `main-storage.bu` by using the following Butane configuration for a control plane node with disk encryption, for example: 

```yaml
variant: openshift
version: 4.22.0
metadata:
  name: main-storage
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
boot_device:
  layout: s390x-virt
  luks:
    cex:
      enabled: true
openshift:
  fips: true
  kernel_arguments:
    - rd.luks.key=/etc/luks/cex.key
```


where: 

`openshift.fips`
     Specifies whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead. 
`openshift.kernel_arguments`
     Specifies the location of the key that is required to decrypt the device. You cannot change this value. 

  2. Create a parameter file that includes `ignition.platform.id=metal` and `ignition.firstboot`. 

**Example kernel parameter file for the control plane machine**

```shell-session
cio_ignore=all,!condev rd.neednet=1 \
console=ttysclp0 \
ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal \
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<http_server>/master.ign \
coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://<http_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img \
ip=<ip_address>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname>::none nameserver=<dns> \
rd.znet=qeth,0.0.bdd0,0.0.bdd1,0.0.bdd2,layer2=1 \
rd.zfcp=0.0.5677,0x600606680g7f0056,0x034F000000000000
```


where: 

`coreos.inst.ignition_url`
     Specifies the location of the Ignition configuration file. Use `master.ign` or `worker.ign`. You can only use the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. 
`coreos.live.rootfs_url`
     Specifies the location of the `rootfs` artifact for the `kernel` and `initramfs` that you want to boot. You can only use the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. 

Note

Write all options in the parameter file as a single line and make sure you have no newline characters. 




#### 2.6.7.1.3. Configuring NBDE with static IP in an IBM Z or IBM LinuxONE environment

Enabling NBDE disk encryption in an IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE environment requires additional steps. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have set up the External Tang Server. See [Network-bound disk encryption](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/configuring-automated-unlocking-of-encrypted-volumes-using-policy-based-decryption_security-hardening#network-bound-disk-encryption_configuring-automated-unlocking-of-encrypted-volumes-using-policy-based-decryption) for instructions. 
  * You have installed the `butane` utility. 
  * You have reviewed the instructions for how to create machine configs with Butane. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create Butane configuration files for the control plane and compute nodes. 

The following example of a Butane configuration for a control plane node creates a file named `master-storage.bu` for disk encryption: 

```yaml
variant: openshift
version: 4.22.0
metadata:
  name: master-storage
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
storage:
  luks:
    - clevis:
        tang:
          - thumbprint: QcPr_NHFJammnRCA3fFMVdNBwjs
            url: http://clevis.example.com:7500
      device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/root
      label: luks-root
      name: root
      wipe_volume: true
  filesystems:
    - device: /dev/mapper/root
      format: xfs
      label: root
      wipe_filesystem: true
openshift:
  fips: true
```


where: 

`openshift.fips`
     Specifies whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead. 

  2. Create a customized initramfs file to boot the machine, by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ coreos-installer pxe customize \
    /root/rhcos-bootfiles/rhcos-<release>-live-initramfs.s390x.img \
    --dest-device /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-<serial_number> --dest-karg-append \
    ip=<ip_address>::<gateway_ip>:<subnet_mask>::<network_device>:none \
    --dest-karg-append nameserver=<nameserver_ip> \
    --dest-karg-append rd.neednet=1 -o \
    /root/rhcos-bootfiles/<node_name>-initramfs.s390x.img
```


Note

Before first boot, you must customize the initramfs for each node in the cluster, and add PXE kernel parameters. 

  3. Create a parameter file that includes `ignition.platform.id=metal` and `ignition.firstboot`. 



```shell-session
cio_ignore=all,!condev rd.neednet=1 \
console=ttysclp0 \
ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal \
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<http_server>/master.ign \
coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://<http_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img \
ip=<ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname>::none nameserver=<dns> \
rd.znet=qeth,0.0.bdd0,0.0.bdd1,0.0.bdd2,layer2=1 \
rd.zfcp=0.0.5677,0x600606680g7f0056,0x034F000000000000 \
zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0
```


\+ where: 

`coreos.inst.ignition_url`
     Specifies the location of the Ignition config file. Use `master.ign` or `worker.ign`. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported. 
`coreos.live.rootfs_url`
    

Specifies the location of the `rootfs` artifact for the `kernel` and `initramfs` you are booting. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported. 

Note

Write all options in the parameter file as a single line and make sure you have no newline characters.

### 2.6.7.2. Fast-track installation by using a prepackaged QCOW2 disk image

Complete the following steps to create the machines in a fast-track installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), importing a prepackaged Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) QEMU copy-on-write (QCOW2) disk image. 

**Prerequisites**

  * At least one LPAR running on RHEL 8.6 or later with KVM, referred to as RHEL KVM host in this procedure. 
  * The KVM/QEMU hypervisor is installed on the RHEL KVM host. 
  * A domain name server (DNS) that can perform hostname and reverse lookup for the nodes. 
  * A DHCP server that provides IP addresses. 



**Procedure**

  1. Obtain the RHEL QEMU copy-on-write (QCOW2) disk image file from the [Product Downloads](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290) page on the Red Hat Customer Portal or from the [RHCOS image mirror](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/s390x/dependencies/rhcos/latest/) page. 

Important

The RHCOS images might not change with every release of OpenShift Container Platform. You must download images with the highest version that is less than or equal to the OpenShift Container Platform version that you install. Only use the appropriate RHCOS QCOW2 image described in the following procedure. 

  2. Download the QCOW2 disk image and Ignition files to a common directory on the RHEL KVM host. 

For example: `/var/lib/libvirt/images`

Note

The Ignition files are generated by the OpenShift Container Platform installer. 

  3. Create a new disk image with the QCOW2 disk image backing file for each KVM guest node. 

```shell-session
$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 -F qcow2 -b /var/lib/libvirt/images/{source_rhcos_qemu} /var/lib/libvirt/images/{vmname}.qcow2 {size}
```


  4. Create the new KVM guest nodes using the Ignition file and the new disk image. 

```shell-session
$ virt-install --noautoconsole \
   --connect qemu:///system \
   --name <vm_name> \
   --memory <memory_mb> \
   --vcpus <vcpus> \
   --disk <disk> \
   --launchSecurity type="s390-pv" \
   --import \
   --network network=<virt_network_parm>,mac=<mac_address> \
   --disk path=<ign_file>,format=raw,readonly=on,serial=ignition,startup_policy=optional
```


The `--launchSecurity type="s390-pv"` parameter is required only if IBM® Secure Execution is enabled. If IBM® Secure Execution is enabled, also replace `serial=ignition` with `serial=ignition_crypted` in the `--disk` parameter. 




### 2.6.7.3. Full installation on a new QCOW2 disk image

Complete the following steps to create the machines in a full installation on a new QEMU copy-on-write (QCOW2) disk image. 

**Prerequisites**

  * At least one LPAR running on RHEL 8.6 or later with KVM, referred to as RHEL KVM host in this procedure. 
  * The KVM/QEMU hypervisor is installed on the RHEL KVM host. 
  * A domain name server (DNS) that can perform hostname and reverse lookup for the nodes. 
  * An HTTP or HTTPS server is set up. 



**Procedure**

  1. Obtain the RHEL kernel, initramfs, and rootfs files from the [Product Downloads](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290) page on the Red Hat Customer Portal or from the [RHCOS image mirror](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/s390x/dependencies/rhcos/latest/) page. 

Important

The RHCOS images might not change with every release of OpenShift Container Platform. You must download images with the highest version that is less than or equal to the OpenShift Container Platform version that you install. Only use the appropriate RHCOS QCOW2 image described in the following procedure. 

The file names contain the OpenShift Container Platform version number. They resemble the following examples: 

     * kernel: `rhcos-<version>-live-kernel-<architecture>`
     * initramfs: `rhcos-<version>-live-initramfs.<architecture>.img`
     * rootfs: `rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img`

  2. Move the downloaded RHEL live kernel, initramfs, and rootfs and the Ignition files to an HTTP or HTTPS server before you launch `virt-install`. 

Note

The Ignition files are generated by the OpenShift Container Platform installer. 

  3. Create the new KVM guest nodes using the RHEL kernel, initramfs, and Ignition files, the new disk image, and adjusted parm line arguments. 

```shell-session
$ virt-install \
   --connect qemu:///system \
   --name <vm_name> \
   --memory <memory_mb> \
   --vcpus <vcpus> \
   --location <media_location>,kernel=<rhcos_kernel>,initrd=<rhcos_initrd> \
   --disk <vm_name>.qcow2,size=<image_size>,cache=none,io=native \
   --network network=<virt_network_parm> \
   --boot hd \
   --extra-args "rd.neednet=1" \
   --extra-args "coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/<block_device>" \
   --extra-args "coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<http_server>/bootstrap.ign" \
   --extra-args "coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://<http_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img" \
   --extra-args "ip=<ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname>::none nameserver=<dns>" \
   --noautoconsole \
   --wait
```


where: 

`--location`
     Specifies the location of the kernel and initrd on the HTTP or HTTPS server. 
`coreos.inst.ignition_url`
     Specifies the location of the Ignition config file. Use `bootstrap.ign`, `master.ign`, or `worker.ign`. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported. 
`coreos.live.rootfs_url`
     Specifies the location of the `rootfs` artifact for the `kernel` and `initramfs` you are booting. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported. 




### 2.6.7.4. Networking options for ISO installations

You can configure advanced options so that you can modify the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) manual installation process. The subsequent sections show examples of networking options for an ISO installation. 

If you install RHCOS from an ISO image, you can add kernel arguments manually when you boot the image to configure networking for a node. If no networking arguments are specified, DHCP is activated in the initramfs when RHCOS detects that networking is required to fetch the Ignition config file. 

Important

When adding networking arguments manually, you must also add the `rd.neednet=1` kernel argument to bring the network up in the initramfs. 

The following information provides examples for configuring networking on your RHCOS nodes for ISO installations. The examples describe how to use the `ip=` and `nameserver=` kernel arguments. 

Note

Ordering is important when adding the kernel arguments: `ip=` and `nameserver=`. 

The networking options are passed to the `dracut` tool during system boot. For more information about the networking options supported by `dracut`, see the `dracut.cmdline` manual page. 

**Additional resources**

  * [`dracut.cmdline` manual page](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/dracut.cmdline.7.html)



#### 2.6.7.4.1. Configuring DHCP or static IP addresses

You can configure an IP address by using either DHCP or an individual static IP address. If you set a static IP, you must then identify the DNS server IP address on each node. 

The configuration examples in the procedure, update the IP addresses for the following components: 

  * The node’s IP address to `10.10.10.2`
  * The gateway address to `10.10.10.254`
  * The netmask to `255.255.255.0`
  * The hostname to `core0.example.com`
  * The DNS server address to `4.4.4.41`
  * The auto-configuration value to `none`. No auto-configuration is required when IP networking is configured statically. 



**Procedure**

  1. Enter a command like the following command to configure a static IP address: 

```shell-session
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
nameserver=4.4.4.41
```


  2. Enter a command like the following command to configure a DHCP IP address: 

```shell-session
ip=enp1s0:dhcp
```


Note

When you use DHCP to configure IP addressing for the RHCOS machines, the machines also obtain the DNS server information through DHCP. For DHCP-based deployments, you can define the DNS server address that is used by the RHCOS nodes through your DHCP server configuration. 

  3. If two or more network interfaces and only one interface exists, disable DHCP on a single interface. In the example, the `enp1s0` interface has a static networking configuration and DHCP is disabled for `enp2s0`, which is not used: 

```shell-session
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
ip=::::core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
```


  4. If you need to combine DHCP and static IP configurations on systems with multiple network interfaces, run the following example command: 

```shell-session
ip=enp1s0:dhcp
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
```


#### 2.6.7.4.2. Configuring an IP address without a static hostname

You can configure an IP address without assigning a static hostname. If a static hostname is not set by the user, the static hostname gets picked up and automatically set by a reverse DNS lookup. 

The configuration examples in the procedure, update the IP addresses for the following components: 

  * The node’s IP address to `10.10.10.2`
  * The gateway address to `10.10.10.254`
  * The netmask to `255.255.255.0`
  * The DNS server address to `4.4.4.41`
  * The auto-configuration value to `none`. No auto-configuration is required when IP networking is configured statically. 



**Procedure**

  * To configure an IP address without a static hostname, enter a command like the following command: 

```shell-session
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0::enp1s0:none
nameserver=4.4.4.41
```


#### 2.6.7.4.3. Specifying multiple network interfaces and DNS servers

You can specify multiple network interfaces by setting multiple `ip=` entries. You can provide multiple DNS servers by adding a `nameserver=` entry for each server, 

**Procedure**

  * To specify multiple network interfaces for your interfaces, you can enter a command like the following command: 

```shell-session
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
ip=10.10.10.3::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
```


  * To provide multiple DNS servers by adding a `nameserver=` entry for each server, enter a command like the following command: 

```shell-session
nameserver=1.1.1.1
nameserver=8.8.8.8
```


#### 2.6.7.4.4. Configuring default gateway and route

As an optional task, you can configure routes to additional networks by setting an `rd.route=` value. 

Note

When you configure one or multiple networks, one default gateway is required. If the additional network gateway is different from the primary network gateway, the default gateway must be the primary network gateway. 

**Procedure**

  * To configure the default gateway, enter the following command: 

```shell-session
ip=::10.10.10.254::::
```


  * To configure the route for an additional network, enter the following command: 

```shell-session
rd.route=20.20.20.0/24:20.20.20.254:enp2s0
```


#### 2.6.7.4.5. Configuring VLANs on individual interfaces

As an optional task, you can configure VLANs on individual interfaces by using the `vlan=` parameter. 

**Procedure**

  * To configure a VLAN on a network interface and use a static IP address, run the following command: 

```shell-session
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0.100:none
vlan=enp2s0.100:enp2s0
```


  * To configure a VLAN on a network interface and to use DHCP, run the following command: 

```shell-session
ip=enp2s0.100:dhcp
vlan=enp2s0.100:enp2s0
```


## 2.6.8. Waiting for the bootstrap process to complete

After your cluster nodes first boot into the persistent RHCOS environment installed to disk, wait for the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process to complete. 

The configuration information provided through the Ignition config files is used to initialize the bootstrap process and install OpenShift Container Platform on the machines. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have created the Ignition config files for your cluster. 
  * You have configured suitable network, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure. 
  * You have obtained the installation program and generated the Ignition config files for your cluster. 
  * You installed RHCOS on your cluster machines and provided the Ignition config files that the OpenShift Container Platform installation program generated. 



**Procedure**

  1. Monitor the bootstrap process: 

```shell-session
$ ./openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for bootstrap-complete \
    --log-level=info
```


where: 

`<installation_directory>`
     Specifies the path to the directory that stores the installation files. 
`--log-level=info`
    

Specifies `warn`, `debug`, or `error` instead of `info` to view different installation details. 

**Example output**

```shell-session
INFO Waiting up to 20m0s for the Kubernetes API at https://api.test.example.com:6443...
INFO API v1.35.4 up
INFO Waiting up to 1h0m0s for bootstrapping to complete...
INFO It is now safe to remove the bootstrap resources
```


The bootstrapping completion wait time varies per platform. 

The command succeeds when the Kubernetes API server signals that it has been bootstrapped on the control plane machines. 

  2. After the bootstrap process is complete, remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer. 

Important

You must remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer at this point. You can also remove or reformat the bootstrap machine itself. 




## 2.6.9. Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

To log in to your cluster as the default system user, export the `kubeconfig` file. This configuration enables the CLI to authenticate and connect to the specific API server created during OpenShift Container Platform installation. 

The `kubeconfig` file is specific to a cluster and OpenShift Container Platform generates it during installation. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You deployed an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. 
  * You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). 



**Procedure**

  1. Export the `kubeadmin` credentials by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
```


where: 

`<installation_directory>`
     Specifies the path to the directory that stores the installation files. 

  2. Verify you can run `oc` commands successfully using the exported configuration by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc whoami
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
system:admin
```


**Next steps**

  * "Customize your cluster" 
  * "Remote health reporting" 



## 2.6.10. Approve the certificate signing requests for your machines

To allow newly added machines to join your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, confirm that the cluster approves pending certificate signing requests (CSRs), or approve them yourself. Approve client requests first, then server requests. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You added machines to your cluster. 



**Procedure**

  1. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines: 

```shell-session
$ oc get nodes
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.35.4
master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.35.4
master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.35.4
```


The output lists all of the machines that you created. 

Note

The preceding output might not include the compute nodes until you approve some CSRs. 

  2. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster: 

```shell-session
$ oc get csr
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
...
```


In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list. 

  3. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines: 

Note

You must approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates rotate, and more than two certificates are present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After you approve the client CSR, the kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. The `machine-approver` then automatically approves later serving certificate renewal requests if the kubelet requests a new certificate with the same parameters. 

Note

For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If you do not approve a request, the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because the API server requires a serving certificate when it connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups submitted the CSR, and confirm the identity of the node. 

     * To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR: 

```shell-session
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
```


where: 

`<csr_name>`
     Specifies the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs. 

     * To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
```


Note

Some Operators might not become available until you approve some CSRs. Each node submits two CSRs, so you might need to run the command to approve CSRs many times. 

  4. After you approve your client requests, review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster: 

```shell-session
$ oc get csr
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
...
```


  5. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines: 

     * To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR: 

```shell-session
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
```


where: 

`<csr_name>`
     Specifies the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs. 

     * To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
```


  6. After you approve all client and server CSRs, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get nodes
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  73m  v1.35.4
master-1  Ready     master  73m  v1.35.4
master-2  Ready     master  74m  v1.35.4
worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.35.4
worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.35.4
```


Note

You might need to wait a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to reach the `Ready` status. 




## 2.6.11. Initial Operator configuration

After the control plane initializes, you must immediately configure some Operators so that they all become available. 

**Prerequisites**

  * Your control plane has initialized. 



**Procedure**

  1. Watch the cluster components come online: 

```shell-session
$ watch -n5 oc get clusteroperators
```


**Example output**

```shell-session

```


  2. Configure the Operators that are not available. 



### 2.6.11.1. Disabling the default software catalog sources

To use only trusted or locally available Operator catalogs, disable the default software catalog sources that OpenShift Container Platform configures during installation. In a restricted network environment, you must disable the default catalogs as a cluster administrator. 

**Procedure**

  * Disable the sources for the default catalogs by adding `disableAllDefaultSources: true` to the `OperatorHub` object: 

```shell-session
$ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
    -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
```


Tip

Or, you can use the web console to manage catalog sources. From the **Administration** **Cluster Settings** **Configuration** **OperatorHub** page, click the **Sources** tab, where you can create, update, delete, disable, and enable individual sources. 




### 2.6.11.2. Image registry storage configuration

The Image Registry Operator is not initially available for platforms that do not provide default storage. After installation, you must configure your registry to use storage so that the Registry Operator is made available. 

Configure a persistent volume, which is required for production clusters. Where applicable, you can configure an empty directory as the storage location for non-production clusters. 

You can also allow the image registry to use block storage types by using the `Recreate` rollout strategy during upgrades. 

#### 2.6.11.2.1. Configure registry storage for IBM Z

As a cluster administrator, following installation you must configure your registry to use storage. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. 
  * You have a cluster on IBM Z®. 
  * You have provisioned persistent storage for your cluster, such as Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation. 

Important

OpenShift Container Platform supports `ReadWriteOnce` access for image registry storage when you have only one replica. `ReadWriteOnce` access also requires that the registry uses the `Recreate` rollout strategy. To deploy an image registry that supports high availability with two or more replicas, `ReadWriteMany` access is required. 

  * You must have a system with at least 100Gi capacity. 



**Procedure**

  1. To configure your registry to use storage, change the `spec.storage.pvc` in the `configs.imageregistry/cluster` resource. 

Note

When you use shared storage, review your security settings to prevent outside access. 

  2. Verify that you do not have a registry pod: 

```shell-session
$ oc get pod -n openshift-image-registry -l docker-registry=default
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
No resources found in openshift-image-registry namespace
```


Note

If you do have a registry pod in your output, you do not need to continue with this procedure. 

  3. Check the registry configuration: 

```shell-session
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io
```


**Example output**

```yaml
storage:
  pvc:
    claim:
```


Leave the `claim` field blank to allow the automatic creation of an `image-registry-storage` PVC. 

  4. Check the `clusteroperator` status: 

```shell-session
$ oc get clusteroperator image-registry
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
NAME             VERSION              AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE   MESSAGE
image-registry   4.22                 True        False         False      6h50m
```


  5. Ensure that your registry is set to managed to enable building and pushing of images. 

     * Run: 

```plaintext
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry/cluster
```


Then, change the line 

```plaintext
managementState: Removed
```


to 

```plaintext
managementState: Managed
```


#### 2.6.11.2.2. Configure storage for the image registry in non-production clusters

You must configure storage for the Image Registry Operator. For non-production clusters, you can set the image registry to an empty directory, but you lose all images if you restart the registry. 

**Procedure**

  * To set the image registry storage to an empty directory: 

```shell-session
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
```


Warning

Configure this option only for non-production clusters. 

If you run this command before the Image Registry Operator initializes its components, the `oc patch` command fails with the following error: 

**Example output**

```shell-session
Error from server (NotFound): configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io "cluster" not found
```


Wait a few minutes and run the command again. 




## 2.6.12. Completing installation on user-provisioned infrastructure

To finalize the installation on user-provisioned infrastructure, complete the cluster deployment after configuring the Operators. This ensures the cluster is fully operational on the infrastructure that you provide. 

**Prerequisites**

  * Your control plane has initialized. 
  * You have completed the initial Operator configuration. 



**Procedure**

  1. Confirm that all the cluster components are online with the following command: 

```shell-session
$ watch -n5 oc get clusteroperators
```


**Example output**

```shell-session

```


Alternatively, the following command notifies you when all of the clusters are available. The command also retrieves and displays credentials: 

```shell-session
$ ./openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for install-complete
```


where: 

`<installation_directory>`
    

Specifies the path to the directory that you stored the installation files in. 

**Example output**

```shell-session
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster to initialize...
```


The command succeeds when the Cluster Version Operator finishes deploying the OpenShift Container Platform cluster from Kubernetes API server. 

Important

     * The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for _Recovering from expired control plane certificates_ for more information. 
     * It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation. 

  2. Confirm that the Kubernetes API server is communicating with the pods. 

     1. To view a list of all pods, use the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get pods --all-namespaces
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
NAMESPACE                         NAME                                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-apiserver-operator      openshift-apiserver-operator-85cb746d55-zqhs8   1/1     Running     1          9m

openshift-apiserver               apiserver-ljcmx                                 1/1     Running     0          1m
openshift-apiserver               apiserver-z25h4                                 1/1     Running     0          2m
openshift-authentication-operator authentication-operator-69d5d8bf84-vh2n8        1/1     Running     0          5m
```


     2. View the logs for a pod that is listed in the output of the previous command by using the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>
```


where: 

`<namespace>`
    

Specifies the pod name and namespace, as shown in the output of an earlier command. 

If the pod logs display, the Kubernetes API server can communicate with the cluster machines. 

  3. For an installation with Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), additional steps are required to enable multipathing. Do not enable multipathing during installation. 

See "Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS" in the _Postinstallation machine configuration tasks_ documentation for more information. 

  4. Register your cluster on the [Cluster registration](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/register) page.
