# 1.2. Requirements for installing OpenShift on a single node

Installing OpenShift Container Platform on a single node alleviates some of the requirements for high availability and large scale clusters. However, you must still address several requirements. 

The following requirements must be met: 

  * **Administration host:** You must have a computer to prepare the ISO, to create the USB boot drive, and to monitor the installation. 

Note

For the `ppc64le` platform, the host should prepare the ISO, but does not need to create the USB boot drive. The ISO can be mounted to PowerVM directly. 

Note

ISO is not required for IBM Z® installations. 

  * **CPU Architecture:** Installing OpenShift Container Platform on a single node supports `x86_64`, `arm64`,`ppc64le`, and `s390x` CPU architectures. 
  * **Supported platforms:** Installing OpenShift Container Platform on a single node is supported on bare metal and Certified third-party hypervisors. See "Certified Hypervisors and Guest Operating Systems" for more information. In most cases, you must specify the `platform.none: {}` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file. The following list shows the only exceptions and the corresponding parameter to specify in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file: 

    * Amazon Web Services (AWS), where you use `platform=aws`
    * Google Cloud, where you use `platform=gcp`
    * Microsoft Azure, where you use `platform=azure`

  * **Production-grade server:** Installing OpenShift Container Platform on a single node requires a server with sufficient resources to run OpenShift Container Platform services and a production workload. 

Table 1.1. Minimum resource requirementsProfile| Compute| Memory| Storage  
---|---|---|---  
Minimum  |  4 vCPUs  |  16 GB of RAM  |  120 GB

Important

Running single-node OpenShift on 4 vCPUs leaves very little "headroom" for user applications, and creates a high risk of resource contention and performance degradation. 

To ensure cluster stability at this threshold, you must take steps to minimize the total resource footprint of the cluster, such as limiting the amount of workloads running on the cluster or limiting cluster capabilities. For more information, see "Cluster capabilities". 

Otherwise, it is recommended to provide more compute resources to the cluster. 

Note

One vCPU generally equals one physical core. However, if you enable simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, each CPU thread counts as a vCPU. 

Adding Operators during the installation process might increase the minimum resource requirements. 

The server must have a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) when booting with virtual media. 

Note

BMC is not supported on IBM Z® and IBM Power®. 

  * **Networking:** The server must have access to the internet or access to a local registry if it is not connected to a routable network. The server must have a DHCP reservation or a static IP address for the Kubernetes API, ingress route, and cluster node domain names. You must configure the DNS to resolve the IP address to each of the following fully qualified domain names (FQDN): 

Table 1.2. Required DNS recordsUsage| FQDN| Description  
---|---|---  
Kubernetes API  |  `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` |  Add a DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and within the cluster.   
Internal API  |  `api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` |  Add a DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record when creating the ISO manually. This record must be resolvable by nodes within the cluster.   
Ingress route  |  `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` |  Add a wildcard DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record that targets the node. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and within the cluster.

Important

Without persistent IP addresses, communications between the `apiserver` and `etcd` might fail.
