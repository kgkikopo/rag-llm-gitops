# 1.5. Verifying that a cluster uses short-term credentials

You can verify that a cluster uses short-term security credentials for individual components by checking the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) configuration and other values in the cluster. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You deployed an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) to implement short-term credentials. 
  * You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). 
  * You are logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges. 



**Procedure**

  * Verify that the CCO is configured to operate in manual mode by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get cloudcredentials cluster \
  -o=jsonpath={.spec.credentialsMode}
```


The following output confirms that the CCO is operating in manual mode: 

**Example output**

```plaintext
Manual
```


  * Verify that the cluster does not have `root` credentials by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get secrets \
  -n kube-system <secret_name>
```


where `<secret_name>` is the name of the root secret for your cloud provider. 

Platform| Secret name  
---|---  
Amazon Web Services (AWS)  |  `aws-creds`  
Microsoft Azure  |  `azure-credentials`  
Google Cloud  |  `gcp-credentials`  
Show more

An error confirms that the root secret is not present on the cluster. 

**Example output for an AWS cluster**

```plaintext
Error from server (NotFound): secrets "aws-creds" not found
```


  * Verify that the components are using short-term security credentials for individual components by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get authentication cluster \
  -o jsonpath \
  --template='{ .spec.serviceAccountIssuer }'
```


This command displays the value of the `.spec.serviceAccountIssuer` parameter in the cluster `Authentication` object. An output of a URL that is associated with your cloud provider indicates that the cluster is using manual mode with short-term credentials that are created and managed from outside of the cluster. 

  * Azure clusters: Verify that the components are assuming the Azure client ID that is specified in the secret manifests by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get secrets \
  -n openshift-image-registry installer-cloud-credentials \
  -o jsonpath='{.data}'
```


An output that contains the `azure_client_id` and `azure_federated_token_file` fields confirms that the components are assuming the Azure client ID. 

  * Azure clusters: Verify that the pod identity webhook is running by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get pods \
  -n openshift-cloud-credential-operator
```


**Example output**
