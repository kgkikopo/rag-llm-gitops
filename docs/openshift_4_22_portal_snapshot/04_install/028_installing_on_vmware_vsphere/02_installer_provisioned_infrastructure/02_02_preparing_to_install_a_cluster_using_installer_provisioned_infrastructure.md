# 2.2. Preparing to install a cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure

You should familiarize yourself with the steps you must perform before install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on vSphere. 

You prepare to install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on vSphere by completing the following steps: 

  * Downloading the installation program. 

Note

If you are installing in a disconnected environment, you extract the installation program from the mirrored content. For more information, see "Mirroring images for a disconnected installation". 

  * Installing the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). 

Note

If you are installing in a disconnected environment, install `oc` to the mirror host. 

  * Generating an SSH key pair. You can use this key pair to authenticate into the OpenShift Container Platform cluster’s nodes after it is deployed. 
  * Adding your vCenter’s trusted root CA certificates to your system trust. 



## 2.2.1. Obtaining the installation program

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on the host you are using for installation, so that installation assets exist for deployment in your environment. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have a machine that runs Linux, for example Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, with 500 MB of local disk space. 

Important

If you attempt to run the installation program on macOS, a known issue related to the `golang` compiler causes the installation of the OpenShift Container Platform cluster to fail. For more information about this issue, see the section named "Known Issues" in the _OpenShift Container Platform 4.22 release notes_ document. 




**Procedure**

  1. Go to the [Cluster Type](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install) page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account. 

Tip

You can also [download the binaries for a specific OpenShift Container Platform release](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/). 

  2. Select your infrastructure provider from the **Run it yourself** section of the page. 
  3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under **OpenShift Installer** and click **Download Installer**. 
  4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files. 

Important

     * The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster. 
     * Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider. 

  5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```


  6. Download your installation [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret). This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for OpenShift Container Platform components. 

Tip

Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/), where you can specify a version of the installation program to download. However, you must have an active subscription to access this page. 




## 2.2.2. Install the OpenShift CLI on Linux

To manage your cluster and deploy applications from the command line on Linux, install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) binary. You can download the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) from the Red Customer Portal. 

Important

If you installed an earlier version of `oc`, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in OpenShift Container Platform. 

Download and install the new version of `oc`. 

**Procedure**

  1. Navigate to the [Download OpenShift Container Platform](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290) page on the Red Hat Customer Portal. 
  2. Select the architecture from the **Product Variant** list. 
  3. Select the appropriate version from the **Version** list. 
  4. Click **Download Now** next to the **OpenShift v4.22 Linux Clients** entry and save the file. 
  5. Unpack the archive: 

```shell-session
$ tar xvf <file>
```


  6. Place the `oc` binary in a directory that is on your `PATH`. 

To check your `PATH`, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ echo $PATH
```


**Verification**

  * After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the `oc` command: 

```shell-session
$ oc <command>
```


## 2.2.3. Install the OpenShift CLI on Windows

To manage your cluster and deploy applications from the command line on Windows, install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) binary. You can download the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) from the Red Customer Portal. 

Important

If you installed an earlier version of `oc`, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in OpenShift Container Platform. 

Download and install the new version of `oc`. 

**Procedure**

  1. Navigate to the [Download OpenShift Container Platform](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290) page on the Red Hat Customer Portal. 
  2. Select the appropriate version from the **Version** list. 
  3. Click **Download Now** next to the **OpenShift v4.22 Windows Client** entry and save the file. 
  4. Extract the archive with a ZIP program. 
  5. Move the `oc` binary to a directory that is on your `PATH` variable. 

To check your `PATH` variable, open the Command Prompt and run the following command: 

```shell-session
C:\> path
```


**Verification**

  * After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the `oc` command: 

```shell-session
C:\> oc <command>
```


## 2.2.4. Install the OpenShift CLI on macOS

To manage your cluster and deploy applications from the command line on macOS, install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) binary. You can download the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) from the Red Customer Portal. 

Important

If you installed an earlier version of `oc`, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in OpenShift Container Platform. 

Download and install the new version of `oc`. 

**Procedure**

  1. Navigate to the [Download OpenShift Container Platform](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290) page on the Red Hat Customer Portal. 
  2. Select the architecture from the **Product Variant** list. 
  3. Select the appropriate version from the **Version** list. 
  4. Click **Download Now** next to the **OpenShift v4.22 macOS Clients** entry and save the file. 

Note

For macOS arm64, choose the **OpenShift v4.22 macOS arm64 Client** entry. 

  5. Extract the archive. 
  6. Move the `oc` binary to a directory on your `PATH` variable. 

To check your `PATH` variable, open a terminal and run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ echo $PATH
```


**Verification**

  * Verify your installation by using an `oc` command: 

```shell-session
$ oc <command>
```


## 2.2.5. Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for the `core` user on each node. 

The key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list for the `core` user on each node, which enables password-less authentication. After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user `core`. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user. 

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The `./openshift-install gather` command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes. 

Important

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required. 

Note

You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches. 

**Procedure**

  1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name>
```


Specifies the path and file name, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your `~/.ssh` directory. 

Note

If you plan to install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures, do not create a key that uses the `ed25519` algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the `rsa` or `ecdsa` algorithm. 

  2. View the public SSH key: 

```shell-session
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` public key: 

```shell-session
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```


  3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the `./openshift-install gather` command. 

Note

On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_dsa` are managed automatically. 

     1. If the `ssh-agent` process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task: 

```shell-session
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
Agent pid 31874
```


Note

If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA. 

  4. Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`: 

```shell-session
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name>
```


Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. 

**Example output**

```shell-session
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


**Next steps**

  * When you install OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program. 



## 2.2.6. Adding vCenter root CA certificates to your system trust

Because the installation program requires access to your vCenter’s API, you must add your vCenter’s trusted root CA certificates to your system trust before you install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. 

**Procedure**

  1. From the vCenter home page, download the vCenter’s root CA certificates. Click **Download trusted root CA certificates** in the vSphere Web Services SDK section. The `<vCenter>/certs/download.zip` file downloads. 
  2. Extract the compressed file that contains the vCenter root CA certificates. The contents of the compressed file resemble the following file structure: 

```plaintext
certs
├── lin
│   ├── 108f4d17.0
│   ├── 108f4d17.r1
│   ├── 7e757f6a.0
│   ├── 8e4f8471.0
│   └── 8e4f8471.r0
├── mac
│   ├── 108f4d17.0
│   ├── 108f4d17.r1
│   ├── 7e757f6a.0
│   ├── 8e4f8471.0
│   └── 8e4f8471.r0
└── win
    ├── 108f4d17.0.crt
    ├── 108f4d17.r1.crl
    ├── 7e757f6a.0.crt
    ├── 8e4f8471.0.crt
    └── 8e4f8471.r0.crl

3 directories, 15 files
```


  3. Add the files for your operating system to the system trust. For example, on a Fedora operating system, run the following command: 

```shell-session
# cp certs/lin/* /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
```


  4. Update your system trust. For example, on a Fedora operating system, run the following command: 

```shell-session
# update-ca-trust extract
```
