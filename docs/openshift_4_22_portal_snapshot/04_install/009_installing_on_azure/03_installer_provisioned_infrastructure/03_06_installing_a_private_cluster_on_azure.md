# 3.6. Installing a private cluster on Azure

In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.22, you can install a private cluster into an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet) on Microsoft Azure. The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can further customize. To customize the installation, you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster. 

## 3.6.1. Private clusters

You can deploy a private OpenShift Container Platform cluster that does not expose external endpoints. Private clusters are accessible from only an internal network and are not visible to the internet. 

By default, OpenShift Container Platform is provisioned to use publicly-accessible DNS and endpoints. A private cluster sets the DNS, Ingress Controller, and API server to private when you deploy your cluster. This means that the cluster resources are only accessible from your internal network and are not visible to the internet. 

Important

If the cluster has any public subnets, load balancer services created by administrators might be publicly accessible. To ensure cluster security, verify that these services are explicitly annotated as private. 

To deploy a private cluster, you must: 

  * Use existing networking that meets your requirements. Your cluster resources might be shared between other clusters on the network. 
  * Deploy from a machine that has access to: 

    * The API services for the cloud to which you provision. 
    * The hosts on the network that you provision. 
    * The internet to obtain installation media. 




### 3.6.1.1. Private clusters in Azure

To create a private cluster on Microsoft Azure, you must provide an existing private VNet and subnets to host the cluster. The installation program resolves required DNS records and configures the Ingress Operator and API server for internal traffic only. 

Depending how your network connects to the private VNET, you might need to use a DNS forwarder to resolve the cluster’s private DNS records. The cluster’s machines use `168.63.129.16` internally for DNS resolution. For more information, see "What is Azure Private DNS?" and "What is IP address 168.63.129.16?". 

The cluster still requires access to internet to access the Azure APIs. 

The following items are not required or created when you install a private cluster: 

  * A `BaseDomainResourceGroup`, since the cluster does not create public records 
  * Public IP addresses 
  * Public DNS records 
  * Public endpoints 

```plaintext
The cluster is configured so that the Operators do not create public records for the cluster and all cluster machines are placed in the private subnets that you specify.
```


#### 3.6.1.1.1. Limitations

Private clusters on Azure are subject to only the limitations that are associated with the use of an existing VNet. 

### 3.6.1.2. User-defined outbound routing

You can configure user-defined outbound routing for a OpenShift Container Platform cluster to reach the internet without public IP addresses or a public load balancer. 

You must use a pre-existing `VNet` for outbound routing when you install a cluster. The installation program does not configure this network. 

When you configure a cluster to use user-defined routing, the installation program does not create the following resources: 

  * Outbound rules for access to the internet. 
  * Public IPs for the public load balancer. 
  * Kubernetes Service object to add the cluster machines to the public load balancer for outbound requests. 



Before you set user-defined routing, ensure that the following items are available: 

  * Egress to the internet so that you can pull container images, unless you use an OpenShift image registry mirror. 
  * Access from the cluster to Azure APIs. 
  * Access to the required allowlist endpoints. 



Several pre-existing networking setups support internet access by using user-defined routing. 

#### 3.6.1.2.1. Private cluster with network address translation

You can use Azure Virtual Network (`VNet`) network address translation (NAT) to provide outbound internet access for the subnets in your cluster. 

When you use a `VNet` setup with Azure NAT and user-defined routing configured, you can create a private cluster with no public endpoints. 

#### 3.6.1.2.2. Private cluster with Azure Firewall

You can use Azure Firewall to provide outbound routing for the `VNet` used to install the cluster. 

When you use a `VNet` setup with Azure Firewall and user-defined routing configured, you can create a private cluster with no public endpoints. 

#### 3.6.1.2.3. Private cluster with a proxy configuration

You can use a proxy with user-defined routing to allow egress to the internet. You must ensure that cluster Operators do not access Azure APIs by using a proxy; Operators must have access to Azure APIs outside of the proxy. 

When you use the default route table for subnets, with `0.0.0.0/0` populated automatically by Azure, all Azure API requests are routed over Azure’s internal network even though the IP addresses are public. As long as the Network Security Group rules allow egress to Azure API endpoints, proxies with user-defined routing configured allow you to create private clusters with no public endpoints. 

#### 3.6.1.2.4. Private cluster with no internet access

You can install a private network that restricts all access to the internet, except the Azure API. Mirror the release image registry locally. Your cluster must have access to the following: 

  * An OpenShift image registry mirror that allows for pulling container images 
  * Access to Azure APIs 



With these requirements available, you can use user-defined routing to create private clusters with no public endpoints.

## 3.6.2. About reusing a VNet for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.22, you can deploy a cluster into an existing Microsoft Azure Virtual Network (VNet). Deployments in an existing VNet require existing subnets and routing rules. 

By deploying OpenShift Container Platform into an existing Azure VNet, you might be able to avoid service limit constraints in new accounts or more easily abide by the operational constraints that your company’s guidelines set. This is a good option to use if you cannot obtain the infrastructure creation permissions that are required to create the VNet. 

### 3.6.2.1. Requirements for using your VNet

When you deploy a cluster by using an existing VNet, you must perform additional network configuration before you install the cluster. 

In installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, the installation program usually creates the following components, but it does not create them when you install into an existing VNet: 

  * Subnets 
  * Route tables 
  * VNets 
  * Network Security Groups 



Note

The installation program requires that you use the cloud-provided DNS server. Using a custom DNS server is not supported and causes the installation to fail. 

If you use a custom VNet, you must correctly configure it and its subnets for the installation program and the cluster to use. The installation program cannot subdivide network ranges for the cluster to use, set route tables for the subnets, or set VNet options like DHCP, so you must do so before you install the cluster. 

The cluster must be able to access the resource group that contains the existing VNet and subnets. While all of the resources that the cluster creates are placed in a separate resource group that it creates, some network resources are used from a separate group. Some cluster Operators must be able to access resources in both resource groups. For example, the Machine API controller attaches NICs for the virtual machines that it creates to subnets from the networking resource group. 

Your VNet must meet the following characteristics: 

  * The VNet’s CIDR block must contain the `Networking.MachineCIDR` range, which is the IP address pool for cluster machines. 
  * The VNet and its subnets must belong to the same resource group, and the subnets must be configured to use Azure-assigned DHCP IP addresses instead of static IP addresses. 



You must provide two subnets within your VNet, one for the control plane machines and one for the compute machines. Because Azure distributes machines in different availability zones within the region that you specify, your cluster will have high availability by default. 

Note

By default, if you specify availability zones in the `install-config.yaml` file, the installation program distributes the control plane machines and the compute machines across availability zones within a region. To ensure high availability for your cluster, select a region with at least three availability zones. If your region contains fewer than three availability zones, the installation program places more than one control plane machine in the available zones. For more information, see "Availability zones" and "Regions". 

To ensure that the subnets that you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms the following data: 

  * All the specified subnets exist. 
  * There are two private subnets, one for the control plane machines and one for the compute machines. 
  * The subnet CIDRs belong to the machine CIDR that you specified. Machines are not provisioned in availability zones that you do not provide private subnets for. 



Note

If you destroy a cluster that uses an existing VNet, the VNet is not deleted. 

#### 3.6.2.1.1. Network security group requirements

The network security groups for the subnets that host the compute and control plane machines require specific access to ensure that the cluster communication is correct. You must create rules to allow access to the required cluster communication ports. 

Important

The network security group rules must be in place before you install the cluster. If you attempt to install a cluster without the required access, the installation program cannot reach the Azure APIs, and installation fails. 

Table 3.20. Required portsPort| Description| Control plane| Compute  
---|---|---|---  
`80` |  Allows HTTP traffic  |  |  x   
`443` |  Allows HTTPS traffic  |  |  x   
`6443` |  Allows communication to the control plane machines  |  x  |   
`22623` |  Allows internal communication to the machine config server for provisioning machines  |  x  |   
Show more

  1. If you are using Azure Firewall to restrict the internet access, then you can configure Azure Firewall to allow the Azure APIs. A network security group rule is not needed. For more information, see "Configuring your firewall" in "Additional resources". 



Important

Currently, there is no supported way to block or restrict the machine config server endpoint. The machine config server must be exposed to the network so that newly-provisioned machines, which have no existing configuration or state, are able to fetch their configuration. In this model, the root of trust is the certificate signing requests (CSR) endpoint, which is where the kubelet sends its certificate signing request for approval to join the cluster. Because of this, machine configs should not be used to distribute sensitive information, such as secrets and certificates. 

To ensure that the machine config server endpoints, ports 22623 and 22624, are secured in bare metal scenarios, customers must configure proper network policies. 

Because cluster components do not modify the user-provided network security groups, which the Kubernetes controllers update, a pseudo-network security group is created for the Kubernetes controller to modify without impacting the rest of the environment.

### 3.6.2.2. Division of permissions

You do not need all of the permissions that are required for an installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster to deploy a cluster. This change mimics the division of permissions that you might have at your company: some individuals can create different resources in your clouds than others. 

For example, you might be able to create application-specific items, like instances, storage, and load balancers, but not networking-related components such as VNets, subnet, or ingress rules. 

The Azure credentials that you use when you create your cluster do not need the networking permissions that are required to make VNets and core networking components within the VNet, such as subnets, routing tables, internet gateways, NAT, and VPN. You still need permission to make the application resources that the machines within the cluster require, such as load balancers, security groups, storage accounts, and nodes. 

### 3.6.2.3. Isolation between clusters

Because the cluster is unable to modify network security groups in an existing subnet, there is no way to isolate clusters from each other on the VNet.

## 3.6.3. Manually creating the installation configuration file

Installing the cluster requires that you manually create the installation configuration file. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have an SSH public key on your local machine for use with the installation program. You can use the key for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery. 
  * You have obtained the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in: 

```shell-session
$ mkdir <installation_directory>
```


Important

You must create a directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version. 

  2. Customize the provided sample `install-config.yaml` file template and save the file in the `<installation_directory>`. 

     1. Edit the `install-config.yaml` file to set the `publish: Internal` parameter. 
     2. If you use your own outbound routing to connect to the internet, set the `outboundType: UserDefinedRouting` parameter. 

Note

You must name this configuration file `install-config.yaml`. 

  3. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use it to install many clusters. 

Important

Back up the `install-config.yaml` file now, because the installation process consumes the file in the next step.

### 3.6.3.1. Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

To ensure that your OpenShift Container Platform cluster runs as expected, each cluster machine must meet minimum CPU, memory, and storage requirements. 

Table 3.23. Minimum resource requirementsMachine| Operating system| vCPU| Virtual RAM| Storage| Input/Output Per Second (IOPS)  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Bootstrap  |  RHCOS  |  4  |  16 GB  |  100 GB  |  300   
Control plane  |  RHCOS  |  4  |  16 GB  |  100 GB  |  300   
Compute  |  RHCOS  |  2  |  8 GB  |  100 GB  |  300   
Show more

  * One vCPU is equal to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs. 
  * OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and Red Hat recommends faster storage, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. On many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to provision more storage to get enough performance. 
  * As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later do not support RHEL 7 compute machines. 



Note

In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.22, RHCOS uses RHEL version 9.8, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. Each architecture requires the following minimum instruction set architectures (ISA): 

  * x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA 
  * ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA 
  * ppc64le architecture requires IBM® Power9 ISA 
  * s390x architecture requires IBM® z14 ISA 



For more information, see [Architectures](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/9.8_release_notes/index#architectures) in the RHEL documentation. 

Important

You must use Azure virtual machines that have the `premiumIO` parameter set to `true`. 

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in OpenShift Container Platform.

### 3.6.3.4. Enabling trusted launch for Azure VMs

To enable trusted launch on Azure virtual machines for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can configure secure boot and virtualized Trusted Platform Modules in the `install-config.yaml` file. Apply the settings to control plane nodes, compute nodes, or all nodes as needed. 

For more information about the sizes of virtual machines that support the trusted launch features, secure boot, and virtualized Trusted Platform Modules, see the Additional resources section. 

Important

Trusted launch is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. 

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see [Technology Preview Features Support Scope](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/). 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have created an `install-config.yaml` file. 



**Procedure**

  * Edit the `install-config.yaml` file before deploying your cluster: 

    * Enable trusted launch only on control plane by adding the following stanza: 

```yaml
controlPlane:
  platform:
    azure:
      settings:
        securityType: TrustedLaunch

### 3.6.3.6. Enabling a user-managed DNS

To manage API and Ingress DNS records in your own system, install your cluster with a DNS solution that you manage. 

This solution replaces the default cluster-provisioned DNS solution. For example, your organization’s security policies might not allow the use of public DNS services such as Microsoft Azure. In such scenarios, you can use your own DNS service to bypass the public DNS service and manage your own DNS for the IP addresses of the API and Ingress services. 

If you enable user-managed DNS during installation, the installation program provisions DNS records for the API and Ingress services only within the cluster. To ensure access from outside the cluster, you must provision the DNS records in an external DNS service of your choice for the API and Ingress services after installation. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You installed the `jq` package. 



**Procedure**

  * Before you deploy your cluster, use a text editor to open the `install-config.yaml` file and add the following stanza: 

    * To enable user-managed DNS: 

```yaml
# ...

platform:
  azure:
    userProvisionedDNS: Enabled
```


where: 

`userProvisionedDNS`
     Enables user-provisioned DNS management. 




**Next steps**

For information about provisioning your DNS records for the API server and the Ingress services, see "Provisioning your own DNS records". 

### 3.6.3.7. Sample customized install-config.yaml file for Azure

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about your OpenShift Container Platform cluster’s platform or modify the values of the required parameters. 

Important

This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your `install-config.yaml` file by using the installation program and modify it. For a full list and description of all installation configuration parameters, see _Installation configuration parameters for Azure_. 

**Sample`install-config.yaml` file for Azure**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
sshKey: ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
metadata:
  name: example-cluster
controlPlane:
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: master
  platform:
    azure:
      type: Standard_D8s_v3
  replicas: 3
compute:
- hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  platform:
    azure:
      type: Standard_D2s_v3
  replicas: 3
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
platform:
  azure:
    baseDomainResourceGroupName: example-basedomain-resourcegroup-name
    region: centralus
```


where: 

`controlPlane`
     Specifies parameters that apply to control plane machines. 
`compute`
     Specifies parameters that apply to compute machines. 
`networking`
     Specifies parameters that apply to the cluster networking configuration. If you do not provide networking values, the installation program provides default values. 
`platform`
     Specifies parameters that apply to the infrastructure platform that hosts the cluster. 

**Additional resources**

  * [Installation configuration parameters for Azure](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html/installing_on_azure/installation-config-parameters-azure "Chapter 7. Installation configuration parameters for Azure")



### 3.6.3.8. Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file. 
  * You have reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, the proxy handles all cluster egress traffic, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the `Proxy` object’s `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary. 

Note

The `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field includes the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration. 

For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field also includes the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`). 




**Procedure**

  1. Edit your `install-config.yaml` file and add the proxy settings. For example: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  noProxy: example.com
additionalTrustBundle: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle>
# ...
```


where: 

`proxy.httpProxy`
     Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`. 
`proxy.httpsProxy`
     Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. 
`proxy.noProxy`
     Specifies a comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 
`additionalTrustBundle`
     If you specify this value, the installation program generates a config map named `user-ca-bundle` in the `openshift-config` namespace to hold the additional CA certificates. If you specify `additionalTrustBundle` and at least one proxy setting, the `Proxy` object references the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The Cluster Network Operator then creates a `trusted-ca-bundle` config map that merges the contents specified for the `trustedCA` parameter with the RHCOS trust bundle. You must set the `additionalTrustBundle` field unless an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle signs the proxy’s identity certificate. 
`additionalTrustBundlePolicy`
    

Specifies the policy that determines the configuration of the `Proxy` object to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The allowed values are `Proxyonly` and `Always`. Use `Proxyonly` to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map only when you configure an `http/https` proxy. Use `Always` to always reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map. The default value is `Proxyonly`. Optional parameter. 

Note

The installation program does not support the proxy `readinessEndpoints` field. 

Note

If the installation program times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installation program. For example: 

```shell-session
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```


  2. Save the file and reference it when installing OpenShift Container Platform. 

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy named `cluster` that uses the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. If you do not give proxy settings, the installation program still creates a `cluster` `Proxy` object, but it has a nil `spec`. 

Note

Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and you cannot create additional proxies.

## 3.6.4. Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the `kube-system` project. If you configured the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file to `Manual`, you must use one of the following alternatives: 

  * To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in [Manually creating long-term credentials](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html/installing_on_azure/installer-provisioned-infrastructure#manually-create-iam_installing-azure-private "3.6.4.1. Manually creating long-term credentials"). 
  * To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in [Configuring an Azure cluster to use short-term credentials](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html/installing_on_azure/installer-provisioned-infrastructure#installing-azure-with-short-term-creds_installing-azure-private "3.6.4.2. Configuring an Azure cluster to use short-term credentials"). 



### 3.6.4.1. Manually creating long-term credentials

You can put the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) into manual mode before OpenShift Container Platform installation if the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not reachable, or if you prefer not to store an administrator-level credential secret in the cluster `kube-system` namespace. 

**Procedure**

  1. If you did not set the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file to `Manual`, modify the value as shown: 

**Sample configuration file snippet**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
# ...
```


  2. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where `<installation_directory>` is the directory in which the installation program creates files. 

  3. Set a `$RELEASE_IMAGE` variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```


  4. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) from the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>
```


where: 

`--included`
     Specifies only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires. 
`<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>`
     Specifies the location of the `install-config.yaml` file. 
`<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>`
    

Specifies the path to the directory where you want to store the `CredentialsRequest` objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it. 

This command creates a YAML file for each `CredentialsRequest` object. 

**Sample`CredentialsRequest` object**

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: <component_credentials_request>
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  ...
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AzureProviderSpec
    roleBindings:
    - role: Contributor
  ...
```


  5. Create YAML files for secrets in the `openshift-install` manifests directory that you generated previously. The secrets must be stored using the namespace and secret name defined in the `spec.secretRef` for each `CredentialsRequest` object. 

**Sample`CredentialsRequest` object with secrets**

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: <component_credentials_request>
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  ...
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AzureProviderSpec
    roleBindings:
    - role: Contributor
      ...
  secretRef:
    name: <component_secret>
    namespace: <component_namespace>
  ...
```


**Sample`Secret` object**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <component_secret>
  namespace: <component_namespace>
data:
  azure_subscription_id: <base64_encoded_azure_subscription_id>
  azure_client_id: <base64_encoded_azure_client_id>
  azure_client_secret: <base64_encoded_azure_client_secret>
  azure_tenant_id: <base64_encoded_azure_tenant_id>
  azure_resource_prefix: <base64_encoded_azure_resource_prefix>
  azure_resourcegroup: <base64_encoded_azure_resourcegroup>
  azure_region: <base64_encoded_azure_region>
```


Important

Before upgrading a cluster that uses manually maintained credentials, you must ensure that the CCO is in an upgradeable state. 




### 3.6.4.2. Configuring an Azure cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that uses Microsoft Entra Workload ID, you must configure the Cloud Credential Operator utility and create the required Azure resources for your cluster. 

#### 3.6.4.2.1. Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility

To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode, extract and prepare the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) binary. 

Note

The `ccoctl` utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform account with cluster administrator access. 
  * You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). 



  * You have created a global Azure account for the `ccoctl` utility to use with the following permissions: 

    * `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read`
    * `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write`
    * `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/delete`
    * `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/read`
    * `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete`
    * `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`
    * `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/read`
    * `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write`
    * `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/delete`
    * `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action`
    * `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/delete`
    * `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read`
    * `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/write`
    * `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/delete`
    * `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read`
    * `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/write`
    * `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/delete`
    * `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/read`
    * `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/write`
    * `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/federatedIdentityCredentials/read`
    * `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/federatedIdentityCredentials/write`
    * `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/federatedIdentityCredentials/delete`
    * `Microsoft.Storage/register/action`
    * `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/register/action`




**Procedure**

  1. Set a variable for the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```


  2. Obtain the CCO container image from the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ CCO_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for='cloud-credential-operator' $RELEASE_IMAGE -a ~/.pull-secret)
```


Note

Ensure that the architecture of the `$RELEASE_IMAGE` matches the architecture of the environment in which you will use the `ccoctl` tool. 

  3. Extract the `ccoctl` binary from the CCO container image within the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc image extract $CCO_IMAGE \
  --file="/usr/bin/ccoctl.<rhel_version>" \
  -a ~/.pull-secret
```


For `<rhel_version>`, specify the value that corresponds to the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) that the host uses. If no value is specified, `ccoctl.rhel8` is used by default. The following values are valid: 

     * `rhel8`: Specify this value for hosts that use RHEL 8. 
     * `rhel9`: Specify this value for hosts that use RHEL 9. 

Note

The `ccoctl` binary is created in the directory from where you executed the command and not in `/usr/bin/`. You must rename the directory or move the `ccoctl.<rhel_version>` binary to `ccoctl`. 

  4. Change the permissions to make `ccoctl` executable by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ chmod 775 ccoctl
```


**Verification**

  * To verify that `ccoctl` is ready to use, display the help file. Use a relative file name when you run the command, for example: 

```shell-session
$ ./ccoctl
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
OpenShift credentials provisioning tool

Usage:
  ccoctl [command]

Available Commands:
  aws          Manage credentials objects for AWS cloud
  azure        Manage credentials objects for Azure
  gcp          Manage credentials objects for Google cloud
  help         Help about any command
  ibmcloud     Manage credentials objects for IBM Cloud
  nutanix      Manage credentials objects for Nutanix

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for ccoctl

Use "ccoctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


#### 3.6.4.2.2. Creating Azure resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You can use the `ccoctl azure create-all` command to automate the creation of Azure resources. 

Note

By default, `ccoctl` creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the `--output-dir` flag. This procedure uses `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>` to refer to this directory. 

**Prerequisites**

You must have: 

  * Extracted and prepared the `ccoctl` binary. 
  * Access to your Microsoft Azure account by using the Azure CLI. 



**Procedure**

  1. Set a `$RELEASE_IMAGE` variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```


  2. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` objects from the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>
```


where: 

`--included`
     Specifies to include only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires. 
`<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>`
     Specifies the location of the `install-config.yaml` file. 
`<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>`
    

Specifies the path to the directory where you want to store the `CredentialsRequest` objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it. 

Note

This command might take a few moments to run. 

  3. To enable the `ccoctl` utility to detect your Azure credentials automatically, log in to the Azure CLI by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ az login
```


  4. Use the `ccoctl` tool to process all `CredentialsRequest` objects by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ ccoctl azure create-all \
  --name=<azure_infra_name> \
  --output-dir=<ccoctl_output_dir> \
  --region=<azure_region> \
  --subscription-id=<azure_subscription_id> \
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credentials_requests_directory> \
  --dnszone-resource-group-name=<azure_dns_zone_resource_group_name> \
  --tenant-id=<azure_tenant_id> \
  --network-resource-group-name <azure_resource_group> \
  --preserve-existing-roles
```


where: 

`<azure_infra_name>`
     Specifies the user-defined name for all created Azure resources used for tracking. 
`<ccoctl_output_dir>`
     Specifies the directory in which you want the `ccoctl` utility to create objects. By default, the utility creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. This parameter is optional. 
`<azure_region>`
     Specifies the Azure region in which cloud resources will be created. 
`<azure_subscription_id>`
     Specifies the Azure subscription ID to use. 
`<path_to_credentials_requests_directory>`
     Specifies the directory containing the files for the component `CredentialsRequest` objects. 
`<azure_dns_zone_resource_group_name>`
     Specifies the name of the resource group containing the cluster’s base domain Azure DNS zone. 
`<azure_tenant_id>`
     Specifies the Azure tenant ID to use. 
`<azure_resource_group>`
     Specifies the virtual network resource group if it is different from the cluster resource group. This parameter is optional. 
`--preserve-existing-roles`
    

Specifies that any custom role assignments you define on managed identities are not removed during OpenShift Container Platform updates. This parameter is optional. 

Note

If your cluster uses Technology Preview features that are enabled by the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set, you must include the `--enable-tech-preview` parameter. 

To see additional optional parameters and explanations of how to use them, run the `azure create-all --help` command. 




**Verification**

  * To verify that the OpenShift Container Platform secrets are created, list the files in the `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests` directory: 

```shell-session
$ ls <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests
```


**Example output**

```plaintext
azure-ad-pod-identity-webhook-config.yaml
cluster-authentication-02-config.yaml
openshift-cloud-controller-manager-azure-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cloud-network-config-controller-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-api-capz-manager-bootstrap-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-azure-disk-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-azure-file-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-image-registry-installer-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-ingress-operator-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-machine-api-azure-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
```


You can verify that the Microsoft Entra ID service accounts are created by querying Azure. For more information, refer to Azure documentation on listing Entra ID service accounts. 




#### 3.6.4.2.3. Incorporating the Cloud Credential Operator utility manifests

To implement short-term security credentials managed outside the cluster for individual OpenShift Container Platform components, you must move the manifest files that the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) created to the correct directories for the installation program. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster. 
  * You have configured the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`). 
  * You have created the cloud provider resources that are required for your cluster with the `ccoctl` utility. 



**Procedure**

  1. If you did not set the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file to `Manual`, modify the value as shown: 

**Sample configuration file snippet**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
# ...
```


  2. If you used the `ccoctl` utility to create a new Azure resource group instead of using an existing resource group, modify the `resourceGroupName` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` as shown: 

**Sample configuration file snippet**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
# ...
platform:
  azure:
    resourceGroupName: <azure_infra_name>
# ...
```


The `<azure_infra_name>` value must match the user-defined name for Azure resources that was specified with the `--name` argument of the `ccoctl azure create-all` command. 

  3. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where `<installation_directory>` is the directory in which the installation program creates files. 

  4. Copy the manifests that the `ccoctl` utility generated to the `manifests` directory that the installation program created by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ cp /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/* ./manifests/
```


  5. Copy the `tls` directory that contains the private key to the installation directory: 

```shell-session
$ cp -a /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/tls .
```


## 3.6.5. Optional: Preparing a private Microsoft Azure cluster for a private image registry

By installing a private image registry on a private Microsoft Azure cluster, you can create private storage endpoints. 

Private storage endpoints disable public facing endpoints to the registry’s storage account, adding an extra layer of security to your OpenShift Container Platform deployment. 

Important

Do not install a private image registry on Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), because the endpoint can put your Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster in an unrecoverable state. 

Use the following guide to prepare your private Microsoft Azure cluster for installation with a private image registry. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform account with cluster administrator access. 
  * You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc). 
  * You have prepared an `install-config.yaml` that includes the following information: 

    * The `publish` field is set to `Internal`

  * You have set the permissions for creating a private storage endpoint. For more information, see "Azure permissions for installer-provisioned infrastructure". 



**Procedure**

  1. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


This command displays the following messages: 

**Example output**

```shell-session
INFO Consuming Install Config from target directory
INFO Manifests created in: <installation_directory>/manifests and <installation_directory>/openshift
```


  2. Create an image registry configuration object and pass in the `networkResourceGroupName`, `subnetName`, and `vnetName` provided by Microsoft Azure. For example: 

```shell-session
$ touch imageregistry-config.yaml
```


```yaml
apiVersion: imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  managementState: "Managed"
  replicas: 2
  rolloutStrategy: RollingUpdate
  storage:
    azure:
      networkAccess:
        internal:
          networkResourceGroupName: <vnet_resource_group>
          subnetName: <subnet_name>
          vnetName: <vnet_name>
        type: Internal
```


where: 

`spec.storage.azure.networkAccess.internal.networkResourceGroupName`
     Specifies the resource group name that contains the existing virtual network (VNet), if you have an existing VNet and subnet setup. This field is optional. 
`spec.storage.azure.networkAccess.internal.subnetName`
     Specifies the name of the existing compute subnet within the specified resource group, if you have an existing VNet and subnet setup. This field is optional. 
`spec.storage.azure.networkAccess.internal.vnetName`
    

Specifies the name of the existing virtual network (VNet) in the specified resource group, if you have an existing VNet and subnet setup. This field is optional. 

Note

The `imageregistry-config.yaml` file is consumed during the installation process. If desired, you must back it up before installation. 

  3. Move the `imageregistry-config.yaml` file to the `<installation_directory/manifests>` folder by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ mv imageregistry-config.yaml <installation_directory/manifests/>

## 3.6.6. Deploying the cluster

To deploy your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you initialize installation by running the `openshift-install create cluster` command from the directory that contains the installation program. The installation program provisions the required infrastructure and completes the cluster setup. 

Important

You can run the `create cluster` command of the installation program only once, during initial installation. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster. 
  * You have the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster. 
  * You have an Azure subscription ID and tenant ID. 
  * If you are installing the cluster using a service principal, you have its application ID and password. 
  * If you are installing the cluster using a system-assigned managed identity, you have enabled it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from. 
  * If you are installing the cluster using a user-assigned managed identity, you have met these prerequisites: 

    * You have its client ID. 
    * You have assigned it to the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from. 




**Procedure**

  1. Optional: If you have run the installation program on this computer before, and want to use an alternative service principal or managed identity, go to the `~/.azure/` directory and delete the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file. 

Deleting this file prevents the installation program from automatically reusing subscription and authentication values from a previous installation. 

  2. In the directory that contains the installation program, initialize the cluster deployment by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \
    --log-level=info
```


where: 

     * `<installation_directory>`: Specifies the location of your customized `./install-config.yaml` file. 
     * `--log-level`: Specifies the log level. To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or `error` instead of `info`. 

If the installation program cannot locate the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file from a previous installation, you are prompted for Azure subscription and authentication values. 

  3. Enter the following Azure parameter values for your subscription: 

     * **azure subscription id** : Enter the subscription ID to use for the cluster. 
     * **azure tenant id** : Enter the tenant ID. 

  4. Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the **azure service principal client id** : 

     * If you are using a service principal, enter its application ID. 
     * If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank. 
     * If you are using a user-assigned managed identity, specify its client ID. 

  5. Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the **azure service principal client secret** : 

     * If you are using a service principal, enter its password. 
     * If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank. 
     * If you are using a user-assigned managed identity,leave this value blank. 

Note

If previously not detected, the installation program creates an `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file and stores this file in the `~/.azure/` directory on your computer. This ensures that the installation program can load the profile when it is creating an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the target platform. 




**Verification**

When the cluster deployment completes successfully: 

  * The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the `kubeadmin` user. 
  * Credential information also outputs to `<installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log`. 

Important

Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster. 

The following example shows the expected output: 

```shell-session
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```


Important

    * The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for _Recovering from expired control plane certificates_ for more information. 
    * It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation. 




## 3.6.7. Provisioning your own DNS records

Use the IP address of the API server to provision your own DNS record with the `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname by using your cluster name and base cluster domain. 

Use the IP address of the Ingress service to provision your own DNS record with the `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname by using your cluster name and base cluster domain. 

**Prerequisite**

  * You have installed the Azure CLI client `(az)`. 



**Procedure**

  1. Add the `userProvisionedDNS` parameter to the `install-config.yaml` file and enable the parameter. For more information, see "Enabling a user-managed DNS". 
  2. Install your cluster. 
  3. If you are installing a private cluster, set the `lb_name` variable by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ lb_name="${infra_id}-internal"
```


     1. Set the `frontendipconfig_id` variable by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ frontendipconfig_id=$(az network lb show -n ${lb_name} -g ${cluster_resource_group_name} -ojson | jq -r ".loadBalancingRules[] | select(.frontendPort == 6443) | .frontendIPConfiguration.id")
```


     2. Set the `frontendipconfig_name` variable by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ frontendipconfig_name=${frontendipconfig_id##*/}
```


     3. To retrieve the IP address of the API service, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ az network lb frontend-ip show -n ${frontendipconfig_name} --lb-name ${lb_name} -g ${cluster_resource_group_name} --query "privateIPAddress" -otsv
```


  4. If you are installing a public cluster, set the `lb_name` variable by running the following command:

```shell-session
$ frontendipconfig_id=$(az network lb show -n ${lb_name} -g ${cluster_resource_group_name} -ojson | jq -r ".loadBalancingRules[] | select(.frontendPort == 6443) | .frontendIPConfiguration.id")
```


     2. Set the `frontendipconfig_name` variable by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ frontendipconfig_name=${frontendipconfig_id##*/}
```


     3. Set the `frontendpublicip_id` variable by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ frontendpublicip_id=$(az network lb frontend-ip show -n ${frontendipconfig_name} --lb-name ${lb_name} -g ${cluster_resource_group_name} --query "publicIPAddress.id" -otsv)
```


     4. To retrieve the IP address of the API service, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ az network public-ip show --ids ${frontendpublicip_id} --query 'ipAddress' -otsv
```


  5. Use the IP address and your cluster name and base cluster domain to configure your own DNS record with the `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname. 
  6. If you are installing a private cluster, set the `lb_name` variable by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ lb_name="${infra_id}-internal"
```


     1. Set the `frontendipconfig_id` variable by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ frontendipconfig_id=$(az network lb show -n ${lb_name} -g ${cluster_resource_group_name} -ojson | jq -r ".loadBalancingRules[] | select(.frontendPort == 443) | .frontendIPConfiguration.id")
```


     2. Set the `frontendipconfig_name` variable by running the following command:

```


     4. To retrieve the IP address of the Ingress service, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ az network public-ip show --ids ${frontendpublicip_id} --query 'ipAddress' -otsv
```


  8. Use the IP address and your cluster name and base cluster domain to configure your own DNS record with the `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.` hostname. 



## 3.6.8. Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

To log in to your cluster as the default system user, export the `kubeconfig` file. This configuration enables the CLI to authenticate and connect to the specific API server created during OpenShift Container Platform installation. 

The `kubeconfig` file is specific to a cluster and OpenShift Container Platform generates it during installation. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You deployed an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. 
  * You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). 



**Procedure**

  1. Export the `kubeadmin` credentials by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
```


where: 

`<installation_directory>`
     Specifies the path to the directory that stores the installation files. 

  2. Verify you can run `oc` commands successfully using the exported configuration by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc whoami
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
system:admin
```
