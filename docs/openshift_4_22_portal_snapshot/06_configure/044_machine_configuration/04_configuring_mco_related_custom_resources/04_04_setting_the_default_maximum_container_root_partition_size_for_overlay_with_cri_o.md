# 4.4. Setting the default maximum container root partition size for Overlay with CRI-O

You can use a `ContainerRuntimeConfig` custom resource (CR) to set a maximum partition size for the root disk of all containers. 

The root partition of each container shows all of the available disk space of the underlying host. 

To configure the maximum Overlay size, as well as other CRI-O options like the log level, you can create the following `ContainerRuntimeConfig` custom resource definition (CRD): 

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: ContainerRuntimeConfig
metadata:
 name: overlay-size
spec:
 machineConfigPoolSelector:
   matchLabels:
     custom-crio: overlay-size
 containerRuntimeConfig:
   logLevel: debug
   overlaySize: 8G
```


**Procedure**

  1. Create the configuration object: 

```shell-session
$ oc apply -f overlaysize.yml
```


  2. To apply the new CRI-O configuration to your worker nodes, edit the worker machine config pool: 

```shell-session
$ oc edit machineconfigpool worker
```


  3. Add the `custom-crio` label based on the `matchLabels` name you set in the `ContainerRuntimeConfig` CRD: 

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2020-07-09T15:46:34Z"
  generation: 3
  labels:
    custom-crio: overlay-size
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/mco-built-in: ""
```


  4. Save the changes, then view the machine configs: 

```shell-session
$ oc get machineconfigs
```


New `99-worker-generated-containerruntime` and `rendered-worker-xyz` objects are created: 

**Example output**

```shell-session
99-worker-generated-containerruntime  4173030d89fbf4a7a0976d1665491a4d9a6e54f1   3.5.0             7m42s
rendered-worker-xyz                   4173030d89fbf4a7a0976d1665491a4d9a6e54f1   3.5.0             7m36s
```


  5. After those objects are created, monitor the machine config pool for the changes to be applied: 

```shell-session
$ oc get mcp worker
```


The worker nodes show `UPDATING` as `True`, as well as the number of machines, the number updated, and other details: 

**Example output**

```shell-session
NAME   CONFIG              UPDATED   UPDATING   DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT   DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT   AGE
worker rendered-worker-xyz False True False     3             2                   2                    0                      20h
```


When complete, the worker nodes transition back to `UPDATING` as `False`, and the `UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT` number matches the `MACHINECOUNT`: 

**Example output**

```shell-session
NAME   CONFIG              UPDATED   UPDATING   DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT   DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT   AGE
worker   rendered-worker-xyz   True      False      False      3         3            3             0           20h
```


Looking at a worker machine, you see that the new 8 GB max size configuration is applied to all of the workers: 

**Example output**

```shell-session
head -n 7 /etc/containers/storage.conf
[storage]
  driver = "overlay"
  runroot = "/var/run/containers/storage"
  graphroot = "/var/lib/containers/storage"
  [storage.options]
    additionalimagestores = []
    size = "8G"
```


Looking inside a container, you see that the root partition is now 8 GB: 

**Example output**

```shell-session
~ $ df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
overlay                   8.0G      8.0K      8.0G   0% /
```
