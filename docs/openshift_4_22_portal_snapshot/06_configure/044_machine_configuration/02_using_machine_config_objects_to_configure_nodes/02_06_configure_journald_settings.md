# 2.6. Configure journald settings

To configure settings for the `journald` service on OpenShift Container Platform nodes, you can modify the appropriate configuration file and pass the file to the appropriate pool of nodes as a machine config. 

This procedure describes how to modify `journald` rate limiting settings in the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file and apply them to worker nodes. See the `journald.conf` man page for information on how to use that file. 

**Prerequisites**

  * Have a running OpenShift Container Platform cluster. 
  * Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create a Butane config file, `40-worker-custom-journald.bu`, that includes an `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file with the required settings. 

Note

The [Butane version](https://coreos.github.io/butane/specs/) you specify in the config file should match the OpenShift Container Platform version and always ends in `0`. For example, `4.22.0`. See "Creating machine configs with Butane" for information about Butane. 

```yaml
variant: openshift
version: 4.22.0
metadata:
  name: 40-worker-custom-journald
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
storage:
  files:
  - path: /etc/systemd/journald.conf
    mode: 0644
    overwrite: true
    contents:
      inline: |
        # Disable rate limiting
        RateLimitInterval=1s
        RateLimitBurst=10000
        Storage=volatile
        Compress=no
        MaxRetentionSec=30s
```


  2. Use Butane to generate a `MachineConfig` object file, `40-worker-custom-journald.yaml`, containing the configuration to be delivered to the worker nodes: 

```shell-session
$ butane 40-worker-custom-journald.bu -o 40-worker-custom-journald.yaml
```


  3. Apply the machine config to the pool: 

```shell-session
$ oc apply -f 40-worker-custom-journald.yaml
```


  4. Check that the new machine config is applied and that the nodes are not in a degraded state. It might take a few minutes. The worker pool will show the updates in progress, as each node successfully has the new machine config applied: 

```shell-session
$ oc get machineconfigpool
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
NAME   CONFIG             UPDATED UPDATING DEGRADED MACHINECOUNT READYMACHINECOUNT UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT AGE
master rendered-master-35 True    False    False    3            3                 3                   0                    34m
worker rendered-worker-d8 False   True     False    3            1                 1                   0                    34m
```


  5. To check that the change was applied, you can log in to a worker node: 

```shell-session
$ oc get node | grep worker
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
ip-10-0-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    worker   39m   v0.0.0-master+$Format:%h$
```


```shell-session
$ oc debug node/ip-10-0-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
Starting pod/ip-10-0-141-142us-east-2computeinternal-debug ...
...
sh-4.2# chroot /host
sh-4.4# cat /etc/systemd/journald.conf
# Disable rate limiting
RateLimitInterval=1s
RateLimitBurst=10000
Storage=volatile
Compress=no
MaxRetentionSec=30s
sh-4.4# exit
```
