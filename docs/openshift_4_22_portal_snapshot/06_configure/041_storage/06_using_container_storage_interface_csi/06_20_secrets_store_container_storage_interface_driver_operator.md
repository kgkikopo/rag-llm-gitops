# 6.20. Secrets Store Container Storage Interface Driver Operator

To improve secret security and integrate with enterprise secret management systems, you can use the Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator to mount secrets from external stores without persisting them on the cluster after pod termination. 

## 6.20.1. Overview of Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator

The Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator mounts secrets from external secret management systems, such as Azure Key Vault, into pods by using a provider plugin. The secrets do not persist on the system after pod termination. 

Secret objects are stored with Base64 encoding. etcd provides encryption at rest for these secrets, but when secrets are retrieved, they are decrypted and presented to the user. If role-based access control is not configured properly on your cluster, anyone with API or etcd access can retrieve or modify a secret. Additionally, anyone who is authorized to create a pod in a namespace can use that access to read any secret in that namespace. 

The Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator, `secrets-store.csi.k8s.io`, enables OpenShift Container Platform to mount multiple secrets, keys, and certificates stored in enterprise-grade external secrets stores into pods as a volume. The Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator communicates with the provider using gRPC to fetch the mount contents from the specified external secrets store. After the volume is attached, the data in it is mounted into the container’s file system. Secrets store volumes are mounted in-line. 

For more information about CSI inline volumes, see "CSI inline ephemeral volumes". 

Familiarity with persistent storage and configuring CSI volumes is recommended when working with a CSI driver. For more information, see "Understanding persistent storage" and "Configuring CSI volumes".

### 6.20.1.1. Secrets store providers

You can store sensitive application data in an external secret management system and use the Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator to mount the secret content as a pod volume. 

The Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator has been tested with the following secrets store providers: 

  * AWS Secrets Manager 
  * AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store 
  * Azure Key Vault 
  * Google Secret Manager 
  * HashiCorp Vault 



Important

IBM Z supports only HashiCorp Vault. 

Note

Red Hat does not test all factors associated with third-party secrets store provider functionality. For more information about third-party support, see the "Red Hat third-party support policy". 

## 6.20.2. About CSI

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) enables storage vendors to deliver plugins through a standard interface without modifying Kubernetes core code, replacing traditional embedded storage drivers. 

CSI Operators give OpenShift Container Platform users storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins. 

## 6.20.3. Support for disconnected environments

You can use certain secrets store providers in disconnected OpenShift Container Platform clusters by configuring VPC endpoints or equivalent connectivity to enable communication between the driver and external secret management systems. 

The following secrets store providers support using the Secrets Store CSI driver in disconnected clusters: 

  * AWS Secrets Manager 
  * Azure Key Vault 
  * Google Secret Manager 
  * HashiCorp Vault 



To enable communication between Secrets Store CSI driver and the secrets store provider, configure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoints or equivalent connectivity to the corresponding secrets store provider, the OpenID Connect (OIDC) issuer, and the Secure Token Service (STS). The exact configuration depends on the secrets store provider, the authentication method, and the type of disconnected cluster. 

Note

For more information about disconnected environments, see "About disconnected environments".

## 6.20.4. Support for network policies

The Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator uses pre-defined `NetworkPolicies` to control ingress and egress traffic for enhanced security of the Operator and driver components. 

The following table summarizes the default ingress and egress rules: 

Component| Ingress ports| Egress ports| Description  
---|---|---|---  
Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator  |  `8443` |  `6443` |  Accesses metrics and communicates with the API server   
Secrets Store CSI driver  |  `8095` |  `6443` |  Accesses metrics and communicates with the API server
