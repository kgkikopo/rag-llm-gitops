# 8.1. Viewing system event information in OpenShift Container Platform clusters

You can view events in OpenShift Container Platform, which are based on events that happen to API objects in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. 

## 8.1.1. Understanding events

Review the following information to learn how OpenShift Container Platform uses _events_ to record information about real-world events in a resource-agnostic manner. Events also allow developers and administrators to consume information about system components in a unified way. 

## 8.1.2. Viewing events using the CLI

You can get a list of events in a given project by using the CLI. 

**Procedure**

  * View events in a project by using a command similar to the following: 

```shell-session
$ oc get events [-n <project>]
```


where: 

`project`
     Specifies the name of the project. 

For example: 

```shell-session
$ oc get events -n openshift-config
```


**Example output**

```shell-session

  * View events in your project from the OpenShift Container Platform console: 

    1. Launch the OpenShift Container Platform console. 
    2. Click **Home** **Events** and select your project. 
    3. Move to resource that you want to see events. For example: **Home** **Projects** <project-name> <resource-name>. 

Many objects, such as pods and deployments, also have an **Events** tab, which shows events related to that object.
