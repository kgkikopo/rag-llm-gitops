# 7.7. Executing remote commands in an OpenShift Container Platform container

You can use the `oc exec` command to execute remote commands in OpenShift Container Platform containers from your local machine. 

## 7.7.1. Executing remote commands in containers

You can use the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to execute remote commands in OpenShift Container Platform containers. By running commands in a container, you can perform troubleshooting, inspect logs, run scripts, and other tasks. 

**Procedure**

  * Use a command similar to the following to run a command in a container: 

```shell-session
$ oc exec <pod> [-c <container>] -- <command> [<arg_1> ... <arg_n>]
```


For example: 

```shell-session
$ oc exec mypod date
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
Thu Apr  9 02:21:53 UTC 2015
```


Important

[For security purposes](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015:1650), the `oc exec` command does not work when accessing privileged containers except when the command is executed by a `cluster-admin` user. 




## 7.7.2. Protocol for initiating a remote command from a client

A client resource in your cluster can initiate the execution of a remote command in a container by issuing a request to the Kubernetes API server. 

The following example is the format for a typical request to a Kubernetes API server: 

```shell-session
/proxy/nodes/<node_name>/exec/<namespace>/<pod>/<container>?command=<command>
```


where: 

`<node_name>`
     Specifies the FQDN of the node. 
`<namespace>`
     Specifies the project of the target pod. 
`<pod>`
     Specifies the name of the target pod. 
`<container>`
     Specifies the name of the target container. 
`<command>`
     Specifies the desired command to be executed. 

**Example request**

```shell-session
/proxy/nodes/node123.openshift.com/exec/myns/mypod/mycontainer?command=date
```


Additionally, the client can add parameters to the request to indicate any of the following conditions: 

  * The client should send input to the remote container’s command (stdin). 
  * The client’s terminal is a TTY. 
  * The remote container’s command should send output from stdout to the client. 
  * The remote container’s command should send output from stderr to the client. 



After sending an `exec` request to the API server, the client upgrades the connection to one that supports multiplexed streams; the current implementation uses **HTTP/2**. 

The client creates one stream each for stdin, stdout, and stderr. To distinguish among the streams, the client sets the `streamType` header on the stream to one of `stdin`, `stdout`, or `stderr`. 

The client closes all streams, the upgraded connection, and the underlying connection when it is finished with the remote command execution request.
