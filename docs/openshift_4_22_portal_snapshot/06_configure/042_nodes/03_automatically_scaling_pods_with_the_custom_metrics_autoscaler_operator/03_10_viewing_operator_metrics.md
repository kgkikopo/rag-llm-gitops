# 3.10. Viewing Operator metrics

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator exposes ready-to-use metrics that it pulls from the on-cluster monitoring component. You can query the metrics by using the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to analyze and diagnose issues. All metrics are reset when the controller pod restarts. 

## 3.10.1. Access performance metrics

You can access the metrics and run queries by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. 

**Procedure**

  1. Select the **Administrator** perspective in the OpenShift Container Platform web console. 
  2. Select **Observe** **Metrics**. 
  3. To create a custom query, add your PromQL query to the **Expression** field. 
  4. To add multiple queries, select **Add Query**. 



### 3.10.1.1. Provided Operator metrics

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator exposes the following metrics, which you can view by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. 

Table 3.1. Custom Metric Autoscaler Operator metricsMetric name| Description  
---|---  
`keda_scaler_activity` |  Whether the particular scaler is active or inactive. A value of `1` indicates the scaler is active; a value of `0` indicates the scaler is inactive.   
`keda_scaler_metrics_value` |  The current value for each scaler’s metric, which is used by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in computing the target average.   
`keda_scaler_metrics_latency` |  The latency of retrieving the current metric from each scaler.   
`keda_scaler_errors` |  The number of errors that have occurred for each scaler.   
`keda_scaler_errors_total` |  The total number of errors encountered for all scalers.   
`keda_scaled_object_errors` |  The number of errors that have occurred for each scaled obejct.   
`keda_resource_totals` |  The total number of Custom Metrics Autoscaler custom resources in each namespace for each custom resource type.   
`keda_trigger_totals` |  The total number of triggers by trigger type.
