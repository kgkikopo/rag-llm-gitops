# 16.6. Destroying a hosted control plane on OpenStack

You might want to remove a hosted cluster if you are no longer using it, you are trying to reduce resources, or the hosted cluster is experiencing issues that are difficult to resolve. 

## 16.6.1. Destroying a hosted cluster on RHOSP by using the CLI

You can destroy a hosted cluster and its associated resources on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) by using the `hcp` CLI tool. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You installed the hosted control planes CLI, `hcp`. 



**Procedure**

  * To destroy the cluster and its associated resources, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ hcp destroy cluster openstack --name=<cluster_name>
```


Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of the hosted cluster. 

After the process completes, your cluster and all resources that are associated with it are destroyed.
