# 7.2. Getting started with dynamic plugins

To get started using the dynamic plugin, you must set up your environment to write a new OpenShift Container Platform dynamic plugin. 

## 7.2.1. Dynamic plugin development

You can run the plugin by using a local development environment. The OpenShift Container Platform web console runs in a container connected to the cluster you have logged into. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You must have cloned the [`console-plugin-template`](https://github.com/openshift/console-plugin-template) repository, which contains a template for creating plugins. 

Important

Red Hat does not support custom plugin code. Only [Cooperative community support](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5893251) is available for your plugin. 

  * You must have an OpenShift Container Platform cluster running. 
  * You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed. 
  * You must have [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. 
  * You must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) v3.2.0 or later or [Podman](https://podman.io/) v3.2.0 or later installed and running. 



**Procedure**

  1. Open two terminal windows. 
  2. In one terminal window, run the following command to install the dependencies for your plugin using yarn. 

```shell-session
$ yarn install
```


  3. After installing, run the following command to start yarn. 

```shell-session
$ yarn run start
```


  4. In another terminal window, login to the OpenShift Container Platform web console through the CLI. 

```shell-session
$ oc login
```


  5. Run the OpenShift Container Platform web console in a container connected to the cluster you have logged in to by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ yarn run start-console
```


Note

The `yarn run start-console` command runs an `amd64` image and might fail when run with Apple Silicon and Podman. You can work around it with `qemu-user-static` by running the following commands: 

```shell-session
$ podman machine ssh
```


```shell-session
$ sudo -i
```


```shell-session
$ rpm-ostree install qemu-user-static
```


```shell-session
$ systemctl reboot
```


**Verification**

  * Visit [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/example) to view the running plugin. Inspect the value of `window.SERVER_FLAGS.consolePlugins` to see the list of plugins which load at runtime.
