# 2.1. About private clusters

You can make a deployed cluster private by restricting DNS, Ingress Controller, and API server access to internal networks. 

By default, OpenShift Container Platform is provisioned using publicly-accessible DNS and endpoints. You can set the DNS, Ingress Controller, and API server to private after you deploy your private cluster. 

Important

If the cluster has any public subnets, load balancer services created by administrators might be publicly accessible. To ensure cluster security, verify that these services are explicitly annotated as private. 

## 2.1.1. DNS

If you install OpenShift Container Platform on installer-provisioned infrastructure, the installation program creates records in a pre-existing public zone and, where possible, creates a private zone for the cluster’s own DNS resolution. In both the public zone and the private zone, the installation program or cluster creates DNS entries for `*.apps`, for the `Ingress` object, and `api`, for the API server. 

The `*.apps` records in the public and private zone are identical, so when you delete the public zone, the private zone seamlessly provides all DNS resolution for the cluster. 

## 2.1.2. Ingress Controller

Because the default `Ingress` object is created as public, the load balancer is internet-facing and in the public subnets. 

The Ingress Operator generates a default certificate for an Ingress Controller to serve as a placeholder until you configure a custom default certificate. Do not use Operator-generated default certificates in production clusters. The Ingress Operator does not rotate its own signing certificate or the default certificates that it generates. Operator-generated default certificates are intended as placeholders for custom default certificates that you configure. 

## 2.1.3. API server

By default, the installation program creates appropriate network load balancers for the API server to use for both internal and external traffic. 

On Amazon Web Services (AWS), separate public and private load balancers are created. The load balancers are identical except that an additional port is available on the internal one for use within the cluster. Although the installation program automatically creates or destroys the load balancer based on API server requirements, the cluster does not manage or maintain them. As long as you preserve the cluster’s access to the API server, you can manually modify or move the load balancers. For the public load balancer, port 6443 is open and the health check is configured for HTTPS against the `/readyz` path. 

On Google Cloud, a single load balancer is created to manage both internal and external API traffic, so you do not need to modify the load balancer. 

On Microsoft Azure, both public and private load balancers are created. However, because of limitations in current implementation, you just retain both load balancers in a private cluster.
