# 2.3. Usage of oc and kubectl commands

Because OpenShift Container Platform is a certified Kubernetes distribution, you can use the Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) that ships with OpenShift Container Platform to interact with your cluster. You can also gain extended functionality specific to OpenShift Container Platform by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) binary. 

## 2.3.1. The oc binary

The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) binary offers the same capabilities as the `kubectl` binary, but it extends to natively support additional OpenShift Container Platform features. 

Full support for OpenShift Container Platform resources
     Resources such as `DeploymentConfig`, `BuildConfig`, `Route`, `ImageStream`, and `ImageStreamTag` objects are specific to OpenShift Container Platform distributions, and build upon standard Kubernetes primitives. 
Authentication
     The `oc` binary offers a built-in `login` command for authentication and lets you work with projects, which map Kubernetes namespaces to authenticated users. Read "Understanding authentication" for more information. 
Additional commands
     The additional command `oc new-app`, for example, makes it easier to get new applications started using existing source code or pre-built images. Similarly, the additional command `oc new-project` makes it easier to start a project that you can switch to as your default. 

Important

If you installed an earlier version of the `oc` binary, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in OpenShift Container Platform 4.22 . If you want the latest features, you must download and install the latest version of the `oc` binary corresponding to your OpenShift Container Platform server version. 

Non-security API changes will involve, at minimum, two minor releases (4.1 to 4.2 to 4.3, for example) to allow older `oc` binaries to update. Using new capabilities might require newer `oc` binaries. A 4.3 server might have additional capabilities that a 4.2 `oc` binary cannot use and a 4.3 `oc` binary might have additional capabilities that are unsupported by a 4.2 server.

## 2.3.2. The kubectl binary

The Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) binary is provided as a means to support existing workflows and scripts for new OpenShift Container Platform users coming from a standard Kubernetes environment, or for those who prefer to use the `kubectl` CLI. 

Existing users of `kubectl` can continue to use the binary to interact with Kubernetes primitives, with no changes required to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. 

You can install the supported `kubectl` binary by following the steps to install the OpenShift CLI. The `kubectl` binary is included in the archive if you download the binary, or is installed when you install the CLI by using an RPM.
