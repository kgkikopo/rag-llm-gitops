# 2.5. Extending the OpenShift CLI with plugins

You can write and install plugins to build on the default `oc` commands, allowing you to perform new and more complex tasks with the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). 

## 2.5.1. Write a CLI plugin

You can write a plugin for the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) in any programming language or script that allows you to write command-line commands. Note that you cannot use a plugin to overwrite an existing `oc` command. 

This procedure creates a simple Bash plugin that prints a message to the terminal when the `oc foo` command is issued. 

**Procedure**

  1. Create a file called `oc-foo`. 

When naming your plugin file, keep the following in mind: 

     * The file must begin with `oc-` or `kubectl-` to be recognized as a plugin. 
     * The file name determines the command that invokes the plugin. For example, a plugin with the file name `oc-foo-bar` can be invoked by a command of `oc foo bar`. You can also use underscores if you want the command to contain dashes. For example, a plugin with the file name `oc-foo_bar` can be invoked by a command of `oc foo-bar`. 

  2. Add the following contents to the file. 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# optional argument handling
if [[ "$1" == "version" ]]
then
    echo "1.0.0"
    exit 0
fi

# optional argument handling
if [[ "$1" == "config" ]]
then
    echo $KUBECONFIG
    exit 0
fi

echo "I am a plugin named kubectl-foo"
```


After you install this plugin for the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), you can invoke it by using the `oc foo` command.

## 2.5.2. Install and use a CLI plugin

After you write a custom plugin for the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), you must install the plugin before you can use it. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You must have the `oc` CLI tool installed. 
  * You must have a CLI plugin file that begins with `oc-` or `kubectl-`. 



**Procedure**

  1. If necessary, update the plugin file to be executable. 

```shell-session
$ chmod +x <plugin_file>
```


  2. Place the file anywhere in your `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin/`. 

```shell-session
$ sudo mv <plugin_file> /usr/local/bin/.
```


  3. Run `oc plugin list` to make sure that the plugin is listed. 

```shell-session
$ oc plugin list
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
The following compatible plugins are available:

/usr/local/bin/<plugin_file>
```


If your plugin is not listed here, verify that the file begins with `oc-` or `kubectl-`, is executable, and is on your `PATH`. 

  4. Invoke the new command or option introduced by the plugin. 

For example, if you built and installed the `kubectl-ns` plugin from the [Sample plugin repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-cli-plugin), you can use the following command to view the current namespace: 

```shell-session
$ oc ns
```


Note that the command to invoke the plugin depends on the plugin file name. For example, a plugin with the file name of `oc-foo-bar` is invoked by the `oc foo bar` command.
