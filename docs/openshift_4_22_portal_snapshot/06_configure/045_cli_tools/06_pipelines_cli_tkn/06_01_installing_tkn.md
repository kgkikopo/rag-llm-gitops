# 6.1. Installing tkn

Use the CLI tool to manage Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines from a terminal. The following section describes how to install the CLI tool on different platforms. 

You can also find the URL to the latest binaries from the OpenShift Container Platform web console by clicking the **?** icon in the upper-right corner and selecting **Command Line Tools**. 

Note

Both the archives and the RPMs contain the following executables: 

  * `tkn`
  * `tkn-pac`
  * `opc`



Important

Running Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines with the `opc` CLI tool is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. 

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see [Technology Preview Features Support Scope](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/).
