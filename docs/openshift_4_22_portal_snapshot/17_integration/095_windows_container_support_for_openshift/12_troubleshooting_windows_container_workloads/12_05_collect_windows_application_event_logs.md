# 12.5. Collect Windows application event logs

The `Get-WinEvent` shim on the kubelet `logs` endpoint can be used to collect application event logs from Windows machines. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). 
  * You have created a Windows compute machine set. 



**Procedure**

  * To view logs from all applications logging to the event logs on the Windows machine, run: 

```shell-session
$ oc adm node-logs -l kubernetes.io/os=windows --path=journal
```


The same command is executed when collecting logs with `oc adm must-gather`. 

Other Windows application logs from the event log can also be collected by specifying the respective service with a `-u` flag. For example, you can run the following command to collect logs for the containerd container runtime service: 

```shell-session
$ oc adm node-logs -l kubernetes.io/os=windows --path=journal -u containerd
```
