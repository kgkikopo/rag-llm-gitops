# 3.5. Deleting a network policy

As a cluster administrator, you can delete a network policy from a namespace. 

## 3.5.1. Delete a network policy using the CLI

You can delete a network policy in a namespace by using the CLI. 

Note

If you log in with `cluster-admin` privileges, you can delete network policies in any namespace in the cluster. 

Note

If you log in with `cluster-admin` privileges, you can delete network policies in any namespace in the cluster. In the web console, you can delete policies directly in YAML or by using the **Actions** menu. 

**Prerequisites**

  * Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports `NetworkPolicy` objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set. 
  * You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). 
  * You logged in to the cluster with a user with `admin` privileges. 
  * You are working in the namespace where the network policy exists. 



**Procedure**

  * To delete a network policy object, enter the following command. Successful output lists the name of the policy object and the `deleted` status. 

```shell-session
$ oc delete networkpolicy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
```


where: 

`<policy_name>`
     Specifies the name of the network policy. 
`<namespace>`
     Optional parameter. If you defined the object in a different namespace than the current namespace, the parameter specifices the namespace.
