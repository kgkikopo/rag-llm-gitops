# 7.4. Understanding the Security Profiles Operator

OpenShift Container Platform administrators can use the Security Profiles Operator to define increased security measures in clusters. 

Important

The Security Profiles Operator supports only Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) worker nodes. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) nodes are not supported. 

## 7.4.1. About security profiles

Security profiles limit what containers can do on a node, so you can reduce the attack surface of workloads in your cluster. 

Seccomp security profiles list the syscalls a process can make. Permissions are broader than SELinux, enabling users to restrict operations system-wide, such as `write`. 

SELinux security profiles provide a label-based system that restricts the access and usage of processes, applications, or files in a system. All files in an environment have labels that define permissions. SELinux profiles can define access within a given structure, such as directories.
