# 12.14. Monitoring Zero Trust Workload Identity Managergit

Track the performance of the Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager by collecting metrics. Configure monitoring to collect metrics from the Security Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIRE) Server and SPIRE Agent components. 

## 12.14.1. Enable user workload monitoring

Enable user workload monitoring to track metrics for your user-defined projects. Configuring this feature allows you to observe application performance and helps you maintain the health of your services. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create the `cluster-monitoring-config.yaml` file to define and configure the `ConfigMap`: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true
```


  2. Apply the `ConfigMap` by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc apply -f cluster-monitoring-config.yaml
```


**Verification**

  * Verify that the monitoring components for user workloads are running in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace: 

```shell-session
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pod
```


**Example output**

```plaintext
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-operator-6cb6bd9588-dtzxq   2/2     Running   0          50s
prometheus-user-workload-0             6/6     Running   0          48s
prometheus-user-workload-1             6/6     Running   0          48s
thanos-ruler-user-workload-0           4/4     Running   0          42s
thanos-ruler-user-workload-1           4/4     Running   0          42s
```


The status of the pods such as `prometheus-operator`, `prometheus-user-workload`, and `thanos-ruler-user-workload` must be `Running`.

## 12.14.2. Configure metrics collection for SPIRE Server by using a ServiceMonitor

To collect custom metrics from the SPIRE Server, create a ServiceMonitor custom resource (CR). This configuration enables the Prometheus Operator to scrape metrics from the default endpoint, which helps you monitor your SPIRE deployment. 

The SPIRE Server operand exposes metrics by default on port `9402` at the `/metrics` endpoint. You can configure metrics collection for the SPIRE Server by creating a `ServiceMonitor` custom resource (CR) that enables the Prometheus Operator to collect custom metrics. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role. 
  * You have installed the Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager. 
  * You have deployed the SPIRE Server operand in the cluster. 
  * You have enabled the user workload monitoring. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create the `ServiceMonitor` CR: 

     1. Create the YAML file that defines the `ServiceMonitor` CR: 

**Example`servicemonitor-spire-server` file**

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
labels:
  app.kubernetes.io/name: server
  app.kubernetes.io/instance: spire
name: spire-server-metrics
namespace: zero-trust-workload-identity-manager
spec:
endpoints:
- port: metrics
  interval: 30s
  path: /metrics
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: server
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: spire
namespaceSelector:
  matchNames:
  - zero-trust-workload-identity-manager
```


     2. Create the `ServiceMonitor` CR by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc create -f servicemonitor-spire-server.yaml
```


After the `ServiceMonitor` CR is created, the user workload Prometheus instance begins metrics collection from the SPIRE Server. The collected metrics are labeled with `job="spire-server"`. 




**Verification**

  1. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to **Observe** **Targets**. 
  2. In the **Label** filter field, enter the following label to filter the metrics targets: 

```shell-session
$ service=zero-trust-workload-identity-manager-metrics-service
```


  3. Confirm that the **Status** column shows `Up` for the `spire-server-metrics` entry.
