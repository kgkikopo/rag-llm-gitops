# 11.7. Configuring an ACME issuer

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift supports using Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) CA servers, such as _Let’s Encrypt_ , to issue certificates. Explicit credentials are configured by specifying the secret details in the `Issuer` API object. Ambient credentials are extracted from the environment, metadata services, or local files which are not explicitly configured in the `Issuer` API object. 

The `Issuer` object is namespace scoped. It can only issue certificates from the same namespace. You can also use the `ClusterIssuer` object to issue certificates across all namespaces in the cluster. 

**Example YAML file that defines the`ClusterIssuer` object**

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: acme-cluster-issuer
spec:
  acme:
    ...
```


Note

By default, you can use the `ClusterIssuer` object with ambient credentials. To use the `Issuer` object with ambient credentials, you must enable the `--issuer-ambient-credentials` setting for the cert-manager controller. 

## 11.7.1. About ACME issuers

The ACME issuer type for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift represents an Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) certificate authority (CA) server. ACME CA servers rely on a _challenge_ to verify that a client owns the domain names that the certificate is being requested for. 

If the challenge is successful, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift can issue the certificate. If the challenge fails, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift does not issue the certificate. 

Note

Private DNS zones are not supported with _Let’s Encrypt_ and internet ACME servers. 

### 11.7.1.1. Supported ACME challenges types

To validate domain ownership with ACME issuers, you can use the challenge types supported by the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. 

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift supports the following challenge types for ACME issuers: 

HTTP-01
     With the HTTP-01 challenge type, you provide a computed key at an HTTP URL endpoint in your domain. If the ACME CA server can get the key from the URL, it can validate you as the owner of the domain. 

Note

HTTP-01 requires that the Let’s Encrypt servers can access the route of the cluster. If an internal or private cluster is behind a proxy, the HTTP-01 validations for certificate issuance fail. 

The HTTP-01 challenge is restricted to port 80. 

DNS-01
     With the DNS-01 challenge type, you provide a computed key at a DNS TXT record. If the ACME CA server can get the key by DNS lookup, it can validate you as the owner of the domain. 

### 11.7.1.2. Supported DNS-01 providers

To configure DNS-01 challenges for ACME issuers, you can validate domain ownership by integrating with supported services, such as Amazon Route 53, Azure DNS, and Google Cloud DNS, or by using Webhooks. 

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift supports the following DNS-01 providers for ACME issuers: 

  * Amazon Route 53 
  * Azure DNS 

Note

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift does not support using Microsoft Entra ID pod identities to assign a managed identity to a pod. 

  * Google Cloud DNS 
  * Webhook 

Red Hat tests and supports DNS providers using an external webhook with cert-manager on OpenShift Container Platform. See "cert-manager-webhook-ibmcis" for the list of DNS providers that are tested and supported with OpenShift Container Platform. 

Note

Using a DNS provider that is not listed might work with OpenShift Container Platform, but the provider was not tested by Red Hat and therefore is not supported by Red Hat.

## 11.7.2. Configure an ACME issuer to solve HTTP-01 challenges

You can use cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift to set up an ACME issuer to solve HTTP-01 challenges. This procedure uses _Let’s Encrypt_ as the ACME CA server. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. 
  * You have a service that you want to expose. In this procedure, the service is named `sample-workload`. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create an ACME cluster issuer. 

     1. Create a YAML file, `acme-cluster-issuer.yaml`, that defines the `ClusterIssuer` object: 

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: <cluster_issuer_name>
spec:
  acme:
    preferredChain: ""
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: <secret_for_private_key>
    server: <url>
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          ingressClassName: <ingress_class_name>
```


where: 

`<cluster_issuer_name>`
     Specifies a name for the cluster issuer. 
`<secret_for_private_key>`
     Specifies the name of secret to store the ACME account private key in. 
`<url>`
     Specifies the URL to access the ACME server’s `directory` endpoint. This example uses the _Let’s Encrypt_ staging environment. 
`<ingress_class_name>`
     Specifies the Ingress class, for example, `openshift-default`. 

     2. Optional: If you create the object without specifying `ingressClassName`, use the following command to patch the existing ingress: 

```shell-session
$ oc patch ingress/<ingress-name> --type=merge --patch '{"spec":{"ingressClassName":"openshift-default"}}' -n <namespace>
```


     3. Create the `ClusterIssuer` object by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc create -f acme-cluster-issuer.yaml
```


  2. Create an Ingress to expose the service of the user workload. 

     1. Create a YAML file, for example, `namespace.yaml`, that defines a `Namespace` object: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: <ingress_namespace>
```


Replace `<ingress_namespace>` with the namespace for the Ingress. 

     2. Create the `Namespace` object by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc create -f namespace.yaml
```


     3. Create a YAML file, for example, `ingress.yaml`, that defines the `Ingress` object: 

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: <ingress_name>
  namespace: <ingress_namespace>
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: <cluster_issuer_name>
spec:
  ingressClassName: <ingress_class_name>
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <tls_hostname>
    secretName: <secret_name>
  rules:
  - host: <hostname>
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: <service_name>
            port:
              number: 80
```


where: 

`<ingress_name>`
     Specifies the name of the Ingress. 
`<ingress_namespace>`
     Specifies the namespace that you created for the Ingress. 
`<cluster_issuer_name>`
     Specifies the cluster issuer that you created. 
`<ingress_class_name>`
     Specifies the Ingress class name. 
`<tls_hostname>`
     Specifies the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) to be associated with the certificate. This name is used to add DNS names to the certificate. 
`<secret_name>`
     Specifies the secret that stores the certificate. 
`<hostname>`
     Specifies the host name. You can use the `<host_name>.<cluster_ingress_domain>` syntax to take advantage of the `*.<cluster_ingress_domain>` wildcard DNS record and serving certificate for the cluster. For example, you might use `apps.<cluster_base_domain>`. Otherwise, you must ensure that a DNS record exists for the chosen hostname. 
`<service_name>`
     Specifies the name of the service to expose. This example uses a service named `sample-workload`. 

     4. Create the `Ingress` object by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc create -f ingress.yaml
```


## 11.7.3. Configure an ACME issuer by using explicit credentials for AWS Route53

You can use cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift to set up an Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) issuer to solve DNS-01 challenges by using explicit credentials on AWS. 

This procedure uses _Let’s Encrypt_ as the ACME certificate authority (CA) server and shows how to solve DNS-01 challenges with Amazon Route 53. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You must provide the explicit `accessKeyID` and `secretAccessKey` credentials. For more information, see [Route53](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/route53/) in the upstream cert-manager documentation. 

Note

You can use Amazon Route 53 with explicit credentials in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster that is not running on AWS.
