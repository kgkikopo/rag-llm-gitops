# 11.4. Configuring the egress proxy for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

If a cluster-wide egress proxy is configured in OpenShift Container Platform, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically configures Operators that it manages with the cluster-wide proxy. OLM automatically updates all of the Operator’s deployments with the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` environment variables. 

You can inject any CA certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections into the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. 

## 11.4.1. Injecting a custom CA certificate for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

If your OpenShift Container Platform cluster has the cluster-wide proxy enabled, you can inject any CA certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections into the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. 
  * You have enabled the cluster-wide proxy for OpenShift Container Platform. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create a config map in the `cert-manager` namespace by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc create configmap trusted-ca -n cert-manager
```


  2. Inject the CA bundle that is trusted by OpenShift Container Platform into the config map by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc label cm trusted-ca config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true -n cert-manager
```


  3. Update the deployment for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift to use the config map by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc -n cert-manager-operator patch subscription openshift-cert-manager-operator --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"config":{"env":[{"name":"TRUSTED_CA_CONFIGMAP_NAME","value":"trusted-ca"}]}}}'
```


**Verification**

  1. Verify that the deployments have finished rolling out by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc rollout status deployment/cert-manager-operator-controller-manager -n cert-manager-operator && \
oc rollout status deployment/cert-manager -n cert-manager && \
oc rollout status deployment/cert-manager-webhook -n cert-manager && \
oc rollout status deployment/cert-manager-cainjector -n cert-manager
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
deployment "cert-manager-operator-controller-manager" successfully rolled out
deployment "cert-manager" successfully rolled out
deployment "cert-manager-webhook" successfully rolled out
deployment "cert-manager-cainjector" successfully rolled out
```


  2. Verify that the CA bundle was mounted as a volume by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get deployment cert-manager -n cert-manager -o=jsonpath={.spec.template.spec.'containers[0].volumeMounts'}
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
[{"mountPath":"/etc/pki/tls/certs/cert-manager-tls-ca-bundle.crt","name":"trusted-ca","subPath":"ca-bundle.crt"}]
```


  3. Verify that the source of the CA bundle is the `trusted-ca` config map by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get deployment cert-manager -n cert-manager -o=jsonpath={.spec.template.spec.volumes}
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
[{"configMap":{"defaultMode":420,"name":"trusted-ca"},"name":"trusted-ca"}]
```
