# 12.3. Grant roles to service accounts

You can grant roles to service accounts in the same way that you grant roles to a regular user account. 

**Procedure**

  1. You can modify the service accounts for the current project. For example, to add the `view` role to the `robot` service account in the `top-secret` project: 

```shell-session
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot
```


Tip

You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role: 

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: view
  namespace: top-secret
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: robot
  namespace: top-secret
```


  2. You can also grant access to a specific service account in a project. For example, from the project to which the service account belongs, use the `-z` flag and specify the `<service_account_name>`

```shell-session
$ oc policy add-role-to-user <role_name> -z <service_account_name>
```


Important

If you want to grant access to a specific service account in a project, use the `-z` flag. Using this flag helps prevent typos and ensures that access is granted to only the specified service account. 

Tip

You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role: 

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <rolebinding_name>
  namespace: <current_project_name>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: <role_name>
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: <service_account_name>
  namespace: <current_project_name>
```


  3. To modify a different namespace, you can use the `-n` option to indicate the project namespace it applies to, as shown in the following examples. 

     * For example, to allow all service accounts in all projects to view resources in the `my-project` project: 

```shell-session
$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n my-project
```


Tip

You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role: 

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: view
  namespace: my-project
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts
```


     * To allow all service accounts in the `managers` project to edit resources in the `my-project` project: 

```shell-session
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts:managers -n my-project
```


Tip

You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role: 

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: edit
  namespace: my-project
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: edit
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts:managers
```
