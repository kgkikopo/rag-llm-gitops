# 7.1. Configuring an htpasswd identity provider

Configure the `htpasswd` identity provider so users can log in to OpenShift Container Platform with credentials from an `htpasswd` file. 

To define an `htpasswd` identity provider, complete these tasks: 

  1. Create an `htpasswd` file to store the user and password information. 
  2. Create a secret to represent the `htpasswd` file. 
  3. Define an `htpasswd` identity provider resource that references the secret. 
  4. Apply the resource to the default OAuth configuration to add the identity provider. 



## 7.1.1. Identity providers in OpenShift Container Platform

You can configure identity providers by creating a custom resource (CR) that describes the provider and adding it to the cluster. Identity providers enable user authentication in OpenShift Container Platform beyond the default `kubeadmin` user. 

Note

OpenShift Container Platform usernames containing `/`, `:`, and `%` are not supported. 

## 7.1.2. About htpasswd authentication

Configure `htpasswd` authentication to use a flat password file for login to OpenShift Container Platform. The file stores hashed credentials for each user and enables local authentication without an external identity provider. 

Warning

Do not use `htpasswd` authentication in OpenShift Container Platform for production environments. Use `htpasswd` authentication only for development environments. 

## 7.1.3. Create the htpasswd file

To configure the `htpasswd` identity provider, create an `htpasswd` file so usernames and hashed passwords are available for the cluster secret. The following procedures describe how to create the file on Linux and Windows Operating Systems. 

  * Creating an `htpasswd` file using Linux 
  * Creating an `htpasswd` file using Windows 



### 7.1.3.1. Create an htpasswd file using Linux

Create a flat `htpasswd` file on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) with the `htpasswd` utility to store usernames and hashed passwords for your cluster. The file enables the `htpasswd` identity provider to authenticate users in OpenShift Container Platform from locally stored credentials. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to the `htpasswd` utility. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), this is available by installing the `httpd-tools` package. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create or update your `htpasswd` file with a username and hashed password by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ htpasswd -c -B -b </path/to/users.htpasswd> <username> <password>
```


The command generates a hashed version of the password. 

For example: 

```shell-session
$ htpasswd -c -B -b users.htpasswd <username> <password>
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
Adding password for user user1
```


  2. Continue to add or update credentials to the file by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ htpasswd -B -b </path/to/users.htpasswd> <user_name> <password>
```


### 7.1.3.2. Create an htpasswd file using Windows

Create a flat `htpasswd` file on Windows with the `htpasswd.exe` utility to store usernames and hashed passwords for your cluster. The file enables the `htpasswd` identity provider to authenticate users in OpenShift Container Platform from locally stored credentials. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to the `htpasswd.exe` utility. On Windows, this utility is included in the `\bin` subdirectory of many Apache httpd distributions. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create or update your `htpasswd` file with a username and hashed password by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ htpasswd.exe -c -B -b <\path\to\users.htpasswd> <username> <password>
```


The command generates a hashed version of the password. 

For example: 

```shell-session
$ htpasswd.exe -c -B -b users.htpasswd <username> <password>
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
Adding password for user user1
```


  2. Continue to add or update credentials to the file by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ htpasswd.exe -b <\path\to\users.htpasswd> <username> <password>
```


## 7.1.4. Create the htpasswd secret

Create an OpenShift Container Platform secret from your `htpasswd` file so the `htpasswd` identity provider can read user credentials for cluster login. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You created an `htpasswd` file. 



**Procedure**

  * Create a `Secret` object that contains the `htpasswd` users file by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc create secret generic htpass-secret --from-file=htpasswd=<path_to_users.htpasswd> -n openshift-config
```


The `--from-file` key must be named `htpasswd`. 

Tip

You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the secret: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: htpass-secret
  namespace: openshift-config
type: Opaque
data:
  htpasswd: <base64_encoded_htpasswd_file_contents>
```


## 7.1.5. Sample htpasswd CR

Review the custom resource fields and acceptable values for configuring an `htpasswd` identity provider in OpenShift Container Platform. 

**htpasswd CR**

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_htpasswd_provider
    mappingMethod: claim
    type: HTPasswd
    htpasswd:
      fileData:
        name: htpass-secret
```


where: 

`spec.identityProviders.name`
     Specifies the provider name, which is prefixed to provider usernames to form an identity name. 
`spec.identityProviders.mappingMethod`
     Specifies how mappings are established between identities from this provider and `User` objects. 
`spec.identityProviders.htpasswd.fileData.name`
     Specifies an existing secret containing a file generated using `htpasswd`. For more information, see "htpasswd".

## 7.1.6. Add an identity provider to your cluster

Apply the identity provider custom resource (CR) to your cluster after you define it. With this configuration, you can authenticate with the configured identity provider. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to a OpenShift Container Platform cluster. 
  * You have created the CR for your identity providers. 
  * You are logged in as an administrator. 



**Procedure**

  1. Apply the defined CR by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc apply -f </path/to/CR>
```


Note

If a CR does not exist, `oc apply` creates a new CR and might trigger the following warning: `Warning: oc apply should be used on resources created by either oc create --save-config or oc apply`. In this case you can safely ignore this warning. 

  2. Log in to the cluster as a user from your identity provider, entering the password when prompted. 

```shell-session
$ oc login -u <username>
```


  3. Confirm that the user logged in successfully and that the username displays by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc whoami
```


## 7.1.7. Update users for an htpasswd identity provider

Update users in the `htpasswd` identity provider so login credentials in OpenShift Container Platform stay in sync when you add or remove accounts. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have created a `Secret` object named `htpass-secret` that contains the `htpasswd` user file. 
  * You have configured an `htpasswd` identity provider named `my_htpasswd_provider`. 
  * You have access to the `htpasswd` utility. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), this is available by installing the `httpd-tools` package. 
  * You have cluster administrator privileges. 



**Procedure**

  1. Retrieve the `htpasswd` file from the `htpass-secret` `Secret` object and save it to your local machine by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get secret htpass-secret -ojsonpath={.data.htpasswd} -n openshift-config | base64 --decode > users.htpasswd
```


  2. Add or remove users from the `users.htpasswd` file by running the following commands: 

     1. To add a new user: 

```shell-session
$ htpasswd -bB users.htpasswd <username> <password>
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
Adding password for user <username>
```


     2. To remove an existing user: 

```shell-session
$ htpasswd -D users.htpasswd <username>
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
Deleting password for user <username>
```


  3. Replace the `htpass-secret` `Secret` object with the updated users in the `users.htpasswd` file by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc create secret generic htpass-secret --from-file=htpasswd=users.htpasswd --dry-run=client -o yaml -n openshift-config | oc replace -f -
```


Tip

You can also apply the following YAML to replace the secret: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: htpass-secret
  namespace: openshift-config
type: Opaque
data:
  htpasswd: <base64_encoded_htpasswd_file_contents>
```


  4. If you removed one or more users, you must remove the existing resources for each user by running the following commands: 

     1. Delete the `User` object: 

```shell-session
$ oc delete user <username>
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
user.user.openshift.io "<username>" deleted
```


Be sure to remove the user, otherwise the user can continue using their token as long as it has not expired. 

     2. Delete the `Identity` object for the user: 

```shell-session
$ oc delete identity my_htpasswd_provider:<username>
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
identity.user.openshift.io "my_htpasswd_provider:<username>" deleted
```


## 7.1.8. Configure identity providers using the web console

You can configure identity providers on your OpenShift Container Platform cluster through the web console by updating the **OAuth** settings in the **Cluster Settings**. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You are logged in to the web console as a cluster administrator. 



**Procedure**

  1. Navigate to **Administration** **Cluster Settings**. 
  2. Under the **Configuration** tab, click **OAuth**. 
  3. Under the **Identity Providers** section, select your identity provider from the **Add** drop-down list. 

Note

You can specify multiple identity providers through the web console without overwriting existing identity providers.
