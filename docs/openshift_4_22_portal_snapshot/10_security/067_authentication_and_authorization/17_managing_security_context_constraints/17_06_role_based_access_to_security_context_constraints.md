# 17.6. Role-based access to security context constraints

You can specify SCCs as resources that are handled by RBAC. This allows you to scope access to your SCCs to a certain project or to the entire cluster. Assigning users, groups, or service accounts directly to an SCC retains cluster-wide scope. 

Important

Do not run workloads in or share access to default projects. Default projects are reserved for running core cluster components. 

The following default projects are considered highly privileged: `default`, `kube-public`, `kube-system`, `openshift`, `openshift-infra`, `openshift-node`, and other system-created projects that have the `openshift.io/run-level` label set to `0` or `1`. Functionality that relies on admission plugins, such as pod security admission, security context constraints, cluster resource quotas, and image reference resolution, does not work in highly privileged projects. 

To include access to SCCs for your role, specify the `scc` resource when creating a role. 

```shell-session
$ oc create role <role-name> --verb=use --resource=scc --resource-name=<scc-name> -n <namespace>
```


This results in the following role definition: 

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
...
  name: role-name
  namespace: namespace
...
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - security.openshift.io
  resourceNames:
  - scc-name
  resources:
  - securitycontextconstraints
  verbs:
  - use
```


where, `name`
     The name of the role. 
`namespace`
     The namespace of the defined role. Defaults to `default` if not specified. 
`apiGroups`
     The API group that includes the `SecurityContextConstraints` resource. Automatically defined when `scc` is specified as a resource. 
`resourceName`
     An example name for an SCC you want to have access. 
`resources`
     The name of the resource group that allows users to specify SCC names in the `resourceNames` field. 
`verbs`
     A list of verbs to apply to the role. 

A local or cluster role with such a rule allows the subjects that are bound to it with a role binding or a cluster role binding to use the user-defined SCC called `scc-name`. 

Note

Because RBAC is designed to prevent escalation, even project administrators are unable to grant access to an SCC. By default, they are not allowed to use the verb `use` on SCC resources, including the `restricted-v2` SCC.
