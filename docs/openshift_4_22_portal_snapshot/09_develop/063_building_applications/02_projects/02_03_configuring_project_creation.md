# 2.3. Configuring project creation

As a cluster administrator, you can allow and configure how developers and service accounts can create, or _self-provision_ , their own projects. 

In OpenShift Container Platform, _projects_ are used to group and isolate related objects. When you request to create a new project by using the web console or `oc new-project` command, an endpoint in OpenShift Container Platform provisions the project according to a template. You can customize this template to meet your needs. 

## 2.3.1. About project creation

When you request a new project, the OpenShift Container Platform API server automatically provisions the new project based on the project template. The project template is identified by the `projectRequestTemplate` parameter in the project configuration resource of the cluster. 

If the parameter is not defined, the API server creates a default template that creates a project with the requested name. The API server then assigns the requesting user to the `admin` role for that project. 

When a project request is submitted, the API substitutes the following parameters into the template: 

Table 2.1. Default project template parametersParameter| Description  
---|---  
`PROJECT_NAME` |  The name of the project. Required.   
`PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME` |  The display name of the project. Might be empty.   
`PROJECT_DESCRIPTION` |  The description of the project. Might be empty.   
`PROJECT_ADMIN_USER` |  The user name of the administrating user.   
`PROJECT_REQUESTING_USER` |  The user name of the requesting user.   
Show more

Access to the API is granted to developers with the `self-provisioner` role and the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding. This role is available to all authenticated developers by default. 

## 2.3.2. Modify the template for new projects

To modify the default project template to customize the resources and settings applied when users create new projects, you can create a custom project template. 

As a cluster administrator, you can modify the default project template so that new projects are created using your custom requirements. 

To create your own custom project template: 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions. 



**Procedure**

  1. Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges. 
  2. Generate the default project template: 

```shell-session
$ oc adm create-bootstrap-project-template -o yaml > template.yaml
```


  3. Use a text editor to modify the generated `template.yaml` file by adding objects or modifying existing objects. 
  4. The project template must be created in the `openshift-config` namespace. Load your modified template: 

```shell-session
$ oc create -f template.yaml -n openshift-config
```


  5. Edit the project configuration resource using the web console or CLI. 

     * Using the web console, complete the following tasks: 

       1. Navigate to the **Administration** **Cluster Settings** page. 
       2. Click **Configuration** to view all configuration resources. 
       3. Find the entry for **Project** and click **Edit YAML**. 

     * Using the CLI, complete the following tasks: 

       1. Edit the `project.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource: 

```shell-session
$ oc edit project.config.openshift.io/cluster
```


  6. Update the `spec` section to include the `projectRequestTemplate` and `name` parameters. Ensure you set the name of your uploaded project template. The default name is `project-request`. 

**Project configuration resource with custom project template**

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
# ...
spec:
  projectRequestTemplate:
    name: <template_name>
# ...
```


  7. After you save your changes, create a new project to verify that your changes were successfully applied. 



## 2.3.3. Disabling project self-provisioning

You can prevent an authenticated user group from self-provisioning new projects. 

**Procedure**

  1. Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges. 
  2. View the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding usage by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc describe clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
Name:		self-provisioners
Labels:		<none>
Annotations:	rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=true
Role:
  Kind:	ClusterRole
  Name:	self-provisioner
Subjects:
  Kind	Name				Namespace
  ----	----				---------
  Group	system:authenticated:oauth
```


Review the subjects in the `self-provisioners` section. 

  3. Remove the `self-provisioner` cluster role from the group `system:authenticated:oauth`. 

     * If the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding binds only the `self-provisioner` role to the `system:authenticated:oauth` group, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{"subjects": null}'
```


     * If the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding binds the `self-provisioner` role to more users, groups, or service accounts than the `system:authenticated:oauth` group, run the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc adm policy \
    remove-cluster-role-from-group self-provisioner \
    system:authenticated:oauth
```


  4. Edit the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding to prevent automatic updates to the role. Automatic updates reset the cluster roles to the default state. 

     * To update the role binding by using the CLI, complete the following steps: 

       1. To edit the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding, enter the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc edit clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners
```


       2. In the displayed role binding, set the `rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate` parameter value to `false`, as shown in the following example: 

```yaml
apiVersion: authorization.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  annotations:
    rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "false"
# ...
```


     * To update the role binding, run the following single command: 

```shell-session
$ oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{ "metadata": { "annotations": { "rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate": "false" } } }'
```


  5. Log in as an authenticated user and verify that the user can no longer self-provision a project: 

```shell-session
$ oc new-project test
```


**Example output**

```shell-session
Error from server (Forbidden): You may not request a new project via this API.
```


Consider customizing this project request message to provide more helpful instructions specific to your organization. 




## 2.3.4. Customizing the project request message

A developer or a service account that is unable to self-provision projects can make a project creation request by using the web console or CLI. 

The following error message is returned by default: 

```shell-session
You may not request a new project via this API.
```


Cluster administrators can customize this message. Consider updating the message to provide further instructions on how to request a new project specific to your organization. The following examples show a customized message: 

  * To request a project, contact your system administrator at `projectname@example.com`. 
  * To request a new project, fill out the project request form located at `https://internal.example.com/openshift-project-request`. 



**Procedure**

  1. Edit the project configuration resource using the web console or CLI. 

     * By using the web console, complete the following steps: 

       1. Navigate to the **Administration** **Cluster Settings** page. 
       2. Click **Configuration** to view all configuration resources. 
       3. Find the entry for **Project** and click **Edit YAML**. 

     * By using the CLI, complete the following steps: 

       1. Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges. 
       2. Edit the `project.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource: 

```shell-session
$ oc edit project.config.openshift.io/cluster
```


  2. Update the `spec` section to include the `projectRequestMessage` parameter and set the value to your custom message: 

**Project configuration resource with custom project request message**

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
# ...
spec:
  projectRequestMessage: <message_string>
# ...
```


The following example uses actual values: 

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
# ...
spec:
  projectRequestMessage: To request a project, contact your system administrator at projectname@example.com.
# ...
```


  3. After saving your changes, attempt to create a new project by using a developer or service account that cannot self-provision projects. By doing this task, you can verify that your changes were successfully applied.
