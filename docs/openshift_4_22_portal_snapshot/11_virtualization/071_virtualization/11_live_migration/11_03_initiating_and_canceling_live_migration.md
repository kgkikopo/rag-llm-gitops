# 11.3. Initiating and canceling live migration

To move a running virtual machine (VM) to a different node without interrupting the workload, you can initiate a live migration. You can also cancel an ongoing migration to keep the VM on its original node. 

You can initiate the live migration of a virtual machine (VM) to another node by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line. 

You can cancel a live migration by using the web console or the command line. The VM remains on its original node. 

Tip

You can also initiate and cancel live migration by using the `virtctl migrate <vm_name>` and `virtctl migrate-cancel <vm_name>` commands. 

## 11.3.1. Start live migration by using the web console

You can live migrate a running virtual machine (VM) to a different node in the cluster by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. 

Note

The **Migrate** action is visible to all users but only cluster administrators can initiate a live migration. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have the `kubevirt.io:migrate` RBAC role or you are a cluster administrator. 
  * The VM is able to be migrated. 
  * If the VM is configured with a host model CPU, the cluster has an available node that supports the CPU model. 



**Procedure**

  1. Navigate to **Virtualization** **VirtualMachines** in the web console. 
  2. Take either of the following steps: 

     * Click the Options menu ![kebab](https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/OpenShift_Container_Platform-4.22-Virtualization-en-US/images/f468284ec3cc9bf27e6bd2c83849ca50/kebab.png) beside the VM you want to migrate, hover over the **Migrate** option, and select **Compute**. 
     * Open the **VM details** page of the VM you want to migrate, click the **Actions** menu, hover over the **Migrate** option, and select **Compute**. 

  3. In the **Migrate Virtual Machine to a different Node** dialog box, select either **Automatically Selected Node** or **Specific Node**. 

     1. If you selected the **Specific Node** option, choose a node from the list. 

  4. Click **Migrate Virtual Machine**. 



## 11.3.2. Start live migration by using the CLI

You can initiate the live migration of a running virtual machine (VM) by using the command line to create a `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object for the VM. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). 
  * You have the `kubevirt.io:migrate` RBAC role or you are a cluster administrator. 



**Procedure**

  1. Create a `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` manifest for the VM that you want to migrate: 

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstanceMigration
metadata:
  name: <migration_name>
spec:
  vmiName: <vm_name>
```


  2. Create the object by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc create -f <migration_name>.yaml
```


The `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object triggers a live migration of the VM. This object exists in the cluster only while the virtual machine instance is running, unless manually deleted. 




**Verification**

  * Obtain the VM status by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc describe vmi <vm_name> -n <namespace>
```


Example output: 

```yaml
# ...
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Probe Time:       <nil>
    Last Transition Time:  <nil>
    Status:                True
    Type:                  LiveMigratable
  Migration Method:  LiveMigration
  Migration State:

    End Timestamp:                2018-12-24T06:19:42Z
    Migration UID:                d78c8962-0743-11e9-a540-fa163e0c69f1
    Source Node:                  node2.example.com
    Start Timestamp:              2018-12-24T06:19:35Z
    Target Node:                  node1.example.com
    Target Node Address:          10.9.0.18:43891
    Target Node Domain Detected:  true
```


## 11.3.3. Cancel live migration by using the web console

You can cancel the live migration of a virtual machine (VM) by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have the `kubevirt.io:migrate` RBAC role or you are a cluster administrator. 



**Procedure**

  1. Navigate to **Virtualization** **VirtualMachines** in the web console. 
  2. Select **Cancel Migration** on the Options menu ![kebab](https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/OpenShift_Container_Platform-4.22-Virtualization-en-US/images/f468284ec3cc9bf27e6bd2c83849ca50/kebab.png) beside a VM. 



## 11.3.4. Cancel live migration by using the CLI

Cancel the live migration of a virtual machine by deleting the `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object associated with the migration. 

**Prerequisites**

  * You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). 
  * You have the `kubevirt.io:migrate` RBAC role or you are a cluster administrator. 



**Procedure**

  * Delete the `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object that triggered the live migration, `migration-job` in this example: 

```shell-session
$ oc delete vmim migration-job
```
