# 18.3. Troubleshoot single-node OpenShift network reconfiguration

Use the following information to diagnose and resolve network reconfiguration issues on single-node OpenShift clusters. 

## 18.3.1. Gather diagnostic information for network reconfiguration issues

You can gather diagnostic information to help troubleshoot network reconfiguration issues on single-node OpenShift clusters. 

**Procedure**

  1. Inspect the `IPConfig` custom resource (CR) status by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc get ipc ipconfig -o yaml
```


Review the `status.conditions` field for the current state, reason, and message. Check `status.validNextStages` for possible stage transitions, and `status.history` for timestamps of stage progression. 

  2. View the Lifecycle Agent controller logs by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc logs -n openshift-lifecycle-agent deployment/lifecycle-agent-controller-manager -c manager
```


  3. Create a debug session on the target node by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
# chroot /host
```


     * Replace `<node_name>` with the name of your single-node OpenShift node. 

  4. View the relevant service logs depending on which phase you are troubleshooting by running one of the following commands: 

     * View the logs for pre-pivot issues by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ sudo journalctl -u lca-ipconfig-pre-pivot -b --no-pager
```


     * View the logs for post-pivot issues by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ sudo journalctl -u ip-configuration.service -b --no-pager
```


     * View the logs for `init-monitor` watchdog issues by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ sudo journalctl -u lca-init-monitor.service -b --no-pager
```


     * View the logs for rollback issues by running the following command: 

```shell-session
$ sudo journalctl -u lca-ipconfig-rollback -b --no-pager
```


## 18.3.2. Network reconfiguration troubleshooting reference

Use the following reference information to help diagnose and resolve network reconfiguration issues on single-node OpenShift clusters. 

Table 18.2. On-node artifacts for troubleshootingFile| Description  
---|---  
`/var/lib/lca/workspace/ip-config-pre-pivot.json` |  Pre-pivot configuration data   
`/var/lib/lca/workspace/ip-config-post-pivot.json` |  Post-pivot configuration data   
`/var/lib/lca/workspace/nmstate.yaml` |  Generated `nmstate` configuration for network changes   
`/var/lib/lca/workspace/recert_config.json` |  Configuration for certificate regeneration   
`/var/lib/lca/workspace/ip-config-autorollback-config.json` |  Auto-rollback configuration   
`/var/lib/lca/workspace/recert-pull-secret.json` |  Pull secret for the recert image, if a custom pull secret was specified   
`/var/lib/lca/ipc.json` |  Persistence file that stores `IPConfig` state for rollback and status continuity across restarts

Table 18.3. Common failure patternsIssue| Cause| Solution  
---|---|---  
Stage transition rejected  |  You attempted to transition to a stage not in `status.validNextStages`.  |  Check `status.validNextStages` and only transition to an allowed stage.   
Specification fields cannot be changed  |  You attempted to modify `spec` fields while the CR is not in the `Idle` stage.  |  Wait for the current operation to complete and the CR to return to `Idle`.   
Health checks never pass  |  Cluster health blockers are preventing progress.  |  Investigate cluster health issues.   
Post-pivot phase failed  |  An error occurred during network configuration or certificate regeneration.  |  Review the post-pivot service logs. If auto-rollback is enabled, the node automatically reverts. Otherwise, manually trigger rollback by setting `spec.stage: Rollback`.   
Pods not receiving new IP family  |  Pre-existing pods might not automatically receive an IP address from the new family because of CNI behavior.  |  Delete and re-create the affected pods to obtain addresses from the new IP family.   
Configuration stuck in disconnected environment  |  The Lifecycle Agent or recert container might be attempting to pull images not available in the disconnected registry.  |  Ensure all required images are mirrored to your disconnected registry before starting. Verify the `lca.openshift.io/recert-pull-secret` annotation references a valid pull secret.
